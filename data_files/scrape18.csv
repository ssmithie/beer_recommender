It\'s poured a hazy golden body beneath a to finger thick head of fluffy white that\'s slowly dropped to just a single finger thick, but this is a sour beer so that\'s actually great head retention, and there\'s even some very nice lacing left behind. In the nose it\'s tropical with a distinct note of coconut backed by sharp fruit. I\'m not finding pineapple but there\'s something there. On to the flavor... there\'s some pineapple there for sure, but I still feel like I\'m getting more coconut. Maybe the coconut just stands out more against the sour base beer. It\'s tart but not too tart, and not at all bitter. I guess it\'s a nice summer beer. In the mouth it\'s light-medium in body and crisp. Overall it\'s a decent gose, but I have a feeling that whether you like this one or not depends more on your personal tastes than anything else.\n\nReview #6,590\xa01,053 charactersNeroFiddled, Jun 04, 2019', ""3.3/5\xa0\xa0rDev -11.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5355ml Can from Brewdog.com (£2.45):\nMedium to slightly faded amber that has a mild haze to it as well & there's a half centimetre, bubbly white head that disappears to leave a tiny bit of lacing around the circumference. The nose is quite tropical with the pineapple most pronounced, there's some sugar sweetness & what I thought to be strawberries coming through as well though; it's slightly funky & sour with some lemon notes & zest too. The taste is a little more sour with a lemonade like flavour kicking things off before the pineapple comes through but it's definitely a touch more subdued than the nose was. Fresh & zesty with some tropical touches, it's more drinkable than I anticipated & comes through with a medium body & moderate carbonation, it's easily the best of the style I've had but it is only the second of the style I've had I guess.\xa0856 charactersflyingpig, May 27, 2019"", '3.96/5\xa0\xa0rDev +6.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; canned 08/15/2018 in Canal Winchester, OH.\nA: Pours an ever so slightly hazy, golden color with brief head formation and somewhat soapy lacing.\nS: Hit hard by pineapple candy up front, but nose resolves rapidly to a slight salted caramel note.\nT: Sweet to semisweet with pineapple candy (think Jolly Rancher), coconut, sea salt, and a touch of caramel.

Piled onto a traditional German styled sour wheat ale, the fruit sees new life.\n\nPouring a slight foggy goldenrod, the spritzy ale rises and falls with a quick, loose froth. Racy aromatics fill the nose with citrus, cider, white wine, tart peach and a cast of light leathery must. Gentle sweetness layers on the tongue with a wafer thin maltiness that's suggestive of sourdough, saltwater taffy and hard candy.\n\nSweetness fades nearly as quick as its froth while the sourness begins to build upon the middle palate. Peach flavors float gently above the natural fruitiness of lime, lemon, white grape, green apple, gooseberry and kiwi. Melon-lie flavors come along a juicy but acidic path with distinct sour, dry, Mountain Dew-esque taste to round out the late palate.\n\nThe softness of perfumy coriander and the rounded flavor from sea salt keeps the ale tasting and feeling full yet bright while the unique acidity of peach bring a slight stone fruit character to the finish. Clean acids wash the thirst with ease as a quick after taste of peach and burlap highlight the beer's brightness and brininess all at once.\xa01,301 charactersBEERchitect, Jul 05, 2018"", '4.21/5\xa0\xa0rDev +5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Appearance - Pours bright yellow with decent white head that quickly dissipates.

I am not a huge Tart/Sour fan, but as a retired US Navy sailor, I do like the saltiness inherent in a Gose. Concord grapes also take me back. Growing up, my maternal grandfather had a Concord grape arbor which he used to grow plump, sweet fruit which we would pick & eat, but they were really for him to make wine in the cellar. His stuff must have been God-awful sweet, but it fermented & he drank it, so to each their own. His son, my uncle, took inspiration and became a home vintner, but I still prefer beer to wine. Onward!\n\nAs always, it began with a Pop! of the cap. I kind of enjoy that aspect of bottles since I have a local artist whose medium is beer bottle caps so they all get set aside for her. Following that moment of Zen, I went with a heavy-handed C-Line pour so as to ensure that all adjuncts were in suspension. I watched as it formed just under two fingers of fizzy, foamy, reddish-white (NOT pink) head with low retention. Color was a faintly hazy reddish-purple Amber (SRM = N/A). Hmm. Nose was kind of like opening a jar of Welch\'s grape jelly in one of those glasses with ""The Archies"" embossed on it! Suddenly, I was back in 1st Grade with a grape PB&J sammich on white bread in my ""Partridge Family"" Thermos lunch box! 8=O The concord grape smell was unmistakable, but this was a Gose, NOT a Fruit & Field Beer. 8=( Once more, the taste was tart, NOT sour! 8={} Man, the concord grape juice dominated, but the spices and lactic acid held its inherent sweetness in check. This was a really bizarre drink, stretching from one end of the spectrum to the other. I couldn\'t make up my mind as to how I felt about it, but it was a dichotomous beer to begin with. Finish was truly in the Twilight Zone between semi-sweet & semi-dry. Pick one, take a sip, wait a moment & see if you don\'t change your mind. Wotta choice of adjuncts! Wotta day this has become!\xa02,136 characterswoodychandler, Oct 21, 2018', ""4.03/5\xa0\xa0rDev +6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4L: Poured from a bottle to a cylinder glass.

Still, I can\'t help but be impressed how well the fruit additions completely transform an otherwise solid but unexceptional gose.\n\nIt tastes exactly like it smells. The initial flavors are intense waves of mixed berries, followed by a light tartness. Lacto near the middle doesn\'t translate quite as vividly as the aroma suggested, but that\'s about the only real niggle. A finish of Greek yogurt and vanilla cream still satisfies immensely. This seems a bit more ""beer-y"" compared to the nose, which I consider a good thing.

The smell started off with a bittersweet citrus adding a slight sweet wheat to eventually take the helm in the aroma. The taste mildly took the previously mentioned flavors and added a touch of salt. There’s a slight lemon aftertaste leading to a wet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a super nice sessionable feel to it. Carbonation feels pretty spot on - fairly low. Overall, for a gose, it’s a tad under on the ""sour"" to ""tart"" part, and the saltiness is pretty low as well.

The taste had tart pickle all over it, and it actually worked quite great with the saltiness too. The mouthfeel was wonderful for the style and had that nice dry tartness with the salt to make you pucker a little.

But will the same apply to a pickle flavored beer? The folks at Urban Artifact think so as they brew a German styled gose that's already equipped with sea salt and coriander. With the start of pickling spices at hand, the summery taste of cucumber is no surprise to the beer world, yet the dill and other pickling spices might be pushing the beer too far.\n\nPale and dirty golden, the hazy beer carries a spritzy light froth that dissipates quickly. Cucumber, herbs and spices leap out immediately over the piquant scent of sourness. Citrus, apple and berries round out the scent while its taste is of sour candy, sourdough and delicate pastry.\n\nWhat little sweetness that the ale started with has retreated quickly before the middle palate. What billows behind is the sharply flavored sourness that takes the shape of lime, lemon, crabapple and cider, gooseberry and honeydew. Lightly winey and briney, the beer's balance comes from the roundness of salinity that plays perfectly into the hands of coriander, dill and underlying additional spices and herbs. A light minty, pepper and straw-like finish allows for the sourness to decide the outcome in taste.\n\nMedium light on the finish, the beer's acidity strips any thirst with ease and becomes this beautiful refreshing course with the complement of herb, spice and yes, pickles to satisfy the culinary curious in much the same way that do summer salads, cucumber mixed drinks and citrusy sports drinks.\xa01,494 charactersBEERchitect, Aug 03, 2017"", ""3.68/5\xa0\xa0rDev -3.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75Gose brewed with (a half ton of) cucumbers, fresh dill, sea salt, and corriander. Poured from a can into an Urban Artifact Thoroughbred tulip. Medium-orange color, fairly clear, and a nice fluffy head that quickly succumbs to the acidity. The nose has a lot of cucumber on it (maybe a little too much). Heavy vegetative aromas and a little vinegar-like note. If I didn't know what was in this beer, I'd think it was a salad.\n\nLight body with a firm feel and a crisp, tart flavor. Soft graininess up front, then a nice, pleasant tart flavor. As soon as it gets tart, huge notes of cucumber roll in. I get a little bit of the dill (not too much), but I don't detect the corriander. \n\nI've never had Cigar City's Cucumber Saison (I hear it's great), but I have had Wicked Weed's Coolcumber. That beer had far too much basil and not enough cucumber. This beer nails the cucumber flavor. Still, when it comes to Gose from this brewer I strongly prefer their Pinwheel and Keypunch to this one. If you like cucumber - I mean REALLY like it - you should seek this out. If you don't, then this beer will offend you. The can says it is the perfect complement to a burger or Reuben. I concur.

There's a little salty tartness, but it does not seem like enough of either at first. However, as you go there's a little breadiness, and the light tartness keeps it easy drinking, while the pickle flavor begins to bloom without becoming the acid bomb that drinking out of a pickle jar would, and it becomes addictive.\n\nThe medium body is smooth and round and finishes semi-dry.

I've been trying a lot of gose beers from craft brews lately and this one is ON POINT. really precise in taste. mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with a medium paced sour finish. the salt is always present however and lingers in the aftertaste. strong.

The label says this is a ""gose"" but it\'s also 6% ABV, which is pretty far above the stylistically-intended ABV maximum for the style. The label also just says ""sour ale"" in another spot, so I don\'t know what this is going to be. Is it gonna be a ""fruited"" gose with a weirdly-high ABV (complete with coriander/salt) or just a regular-ol\' kettle sour with coconut flavor? Who knows? That\'s why I review these oddities.\n\nPours a medium-hazy golden orange color with some blonde highlights. The head seemed pretty voluminous and intense upon initial pour, but it really petered out (thanks, lactobacillus!) after a few minutes. However, there\'s still a small ring of white bubbles adorning the top of this brew. Some bubbles rise to the surface rather nonchalantly, and overall the carbonation seems pretty meh. Not much else to say here... a standard gose pour... slightly better than I expected, actually.\n\nThe nose is really unique, but I\'m not sure it comes together as well as it probably did in theory. First of all, this is most certainly a coriander-forward, mineral-laden gose beer. It\'s just randomly 6% where it probably should have been in the mid-4\'s, but whatever. Anyway, I get a lot of spicy, grassy and semi-funky coriander with some more earthy spice and a big hit of coconut as well. Like, the whole fruit. Shredded coconut, too. Some cinnamon-like spice... It\'s not just coconut milk... this really has the sweaty, tropical aspect going on, almost in the ""uncanny valley"" sense of things. Y\'know, it\'s almost too much like coconut but there\'s something off about it? Weirdly enough, I loved how they used this flavor adjunct in their collaborative IPA with J. Wakefield, Smooth Beats Miami. This smells very interesting, but I\'m not overly-convinced by it for whatever reason. Something doesn\'t jive well. Maybe too much on the sour side of things... there\'s a sharp citric note here that doesn\'t work with the nutty adjunct elements.\n\nOn the tongue, this comes together slightly better. It\'s a bit heavy bodied and syrupy, but the spicing and flavors are pretty accurate for what they were clearly going for. The baking spice (nutmeg/cinnamon)-esque flavors work pretty well with the coconut which has an earthy and nutty element to it. The base sour seems kinda distracting at first, but seems to blend in better over time. I think they should dial the acidity back a bit next time they brew this (if there is a next time)... it just feels overwhelming, and overshadows the tropical flavors I know this wants to exude. Overall, not a bad beer, but not the brewery\'s best use of coconut as a flavoring either. This would probably work better with pineapple when it comes to stereotypical tropical flavors, but what do I know?\xa02,875 charactersichorNet, Feb 17, 2018']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/33901/328305/

The tartness and acidity intensified as the beer moved along the palate. Lemon notes and a hint of briny salinity appeared on the finish.\n\nUltra light and fluffy mouthfeel. The liquid contained a fine yet aggressive effervescence that came across as a touch airy initially.

But its creamy, short-lived froth abounds with the bright scent of tropical fruits, citrus fruits, herbal and piney aromas along with a brisk scent of the sea. Light sweetness touches the tongue as a modest savory tone of bread crust and sun kissed grains seem honey and caramel-like, but very, very soft.\n\nComing alive on the middle palate, the acidic taste comes quick. Buffered by bread crust, the acidity does off an apprehensive patience while the taste of matured pineapple rind, mango, apricot, lime, lemon and green apple take a sharp and succulent taste. Seeming margarita-like with strands of agave, chardonnay and gin, the beer's earthen salinity plays into a slightly robust taste of sourness for balance, complexity and rustic charm.\n\nMedium light in body, the taste trends dry as the acidity takes hold. Salty, citrusy, piney, grassy, cidery and surprisingly toasty, the melange of flavors are impressively balanced while the ale trails into a short, crisp, clean, but rounded display of culinary art- all on the bright, beach, and sunshiny side.\xa01,368 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 18, 2017"", '4/5\xa0\xa0rDev +2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Sweet/tart/sour.

Small but chunky spots of lace cling to the glass after each drink.\n\nThe nose has a wheaty twang, damp graininess if you will, along with a bit of minerality as well. Briney. The dry hopping brings a really interesting and fun element to the style with some orange and lime notes. There's a nice citric quality that hints at acidity with both lemon and lime. There is a fresh, green floral character as well. I'm a fan, I have to say, my mouth is watering.\n\nThe flavor profile is brighter and punchier than the nose but the basis is the same. Damp wheat is the first twang with the salty minerality quickly rising up its back. The dry hopping brings a vivid citrusy punch to the middle with orange juice, lime zest and juice, and a squeeze of lemon. A citrus fruit basket of sorts. There's saltiness, acidity, and even a touch of bitterness. I'm a fan of this beer, fo' sho'.\n\nThe feel fits the style well. The body's weight sits a touch shy of moderate while the carbonation is zippy upfront before softening and allowing the body to take on a velvety softness.

A pint is not enough.\n\nHop Gose Weasel is a mighty fine beer from the mighty fine Marz Brewing Co and the mighty fine folk from Bridgeport.

This was filled one day before consumption at the source, and promptly went into the fridge until drinking. (Notes transcribed later, after taking them.) Freshy-fresh. \n\nAppearance (4.75): Pouring leads to a two-finger, light pink head that’s soft and shows decent retention (particularly for the style). Still, it dissipates to a thin collar at the surface. The body is a glowing, deep pink, like watermelon juice, and fairly hazy—but not quite opaque. Absolutely gorgeous. \n\nSmell (4.0): Light and bright lactic acid, a little coriander, the clear, strident citrus character of lime juice, and just enough cherry sweetness to flesh out the body. That lactic tang shines over all, in the end. \n\nTaste (4.5): The acidic blend of lactic and citrusy snap rule from start to finish: the beer comes in with an almost Greek yogurt-like sourness, funky but acidic, and moves to the midsection, off of the sour and onto the soft, floury wheat malt. The malt character turns into a bready note, like common crackers. Slight cherry sweetness, cut by lime bitterness, follows. That lime acidity follows through to the finish. On the mid-palate, the fruitiness slightly precedes the wheaty malt base, but soon they mingle together fairly evenly. A modest saltiness hangs out on the side all along, nicely complementing the fruity and bready flavors, drying them out slightly with that savory side. \n\nMouthfeel (4.0): Immediately from the get-go, the sour and salty notes dry out and lighten the slightly light- side of medium-weight body. Fine, tingly carbonation washes in, covers all surfaces, and then washes out with an even lighter-weight body. \n\nOverall (4.25): This beer an absolute joy to drink, for me. Way too easy to drink, frankly. The mix of a nice, wheaty gose with the sweetness of the cherry and the acidic twang of the lime juice makes for an absurdly refreshing drink without any of the potentially off-putting characteristics of the gose style.

It is out of order, but I scored a CAN of this one as I am wrapping up my foray into the Sue Grafton series of beers. I don\'t think that I bought either A or B when they were released, but I plan to stay current from now on. Viva The CANQuest (tm)!\n\nFrom the CAN: ""Let\'s face it - we all like to put labels on things. It just makes us feel more comfortable. What assumptions have people made about you based on your race, religion, gender, the way you dress, or even the beer you drink? We did in fact label this beer for your convenience. It his a fresh tartness, a twist of salt and a balanced fruitiness of cherry - apparently a complete reflection of your personality. We hope you like what this label says about you?"" \n\nI Crack!ed the vent following some in-CAN agitation to ensure that any flocculate was back in suspension. After all, I was going for full-on Cherry! My C-Line Glug was more heavy-handed than usual, but again, it was a matter of getting the most out of this one. Man, it quickly foamed up to the point that I had to back down. It briefly formed two fingers of fizzy, foamy, soapy, pinkish head that quickly dissipated into wisps. 8=( Color was a cloudy pinkish-Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9), akin to freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice. Nose was redolent with sour cherries and a saltiness that was like standing on the forecastle in heavy seas, taking in the air. I always loved the smell of salt air while underway. Sigh. Mouthfeel was on-par for the style, which is to say kind of thin & watery. The taste was nice, but not traditional, thanks to the addition of sour cherries. Wow! If it was not tangy enough at its base, now it was downright puckering in its tartness! As to the style, this is from the site\'s revamped ""Beer Styles"" guide: ""A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose [may be] present, in harmony with other aromas."" Fair dinkum! Man, this was an interesting twist on Gose, for sure. I am not a tart/sour guy by any stretch, but I gravitate towards Goses more than others simply because of their inherent saltiness. This did NOT disappoint in that department as it was not only tart from the cherries and sour from the lactic acid, but they did not hold back in the addition of salt.

Hang on, \'cause it\'s going to be a wild ride today. \n\nFrom the Bottle: ""Apple*Tangy*Crisp""; ""Proudly Brewed in Holland[,] Michigan"".\n\nI began by Pop!ping the cap & performing a slow, gentle C-Line pour. I was pleasantly surprised when it foamed up to form just over two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with above-average retention that left nice lacing in its wake. Color was a gorgeous Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity, leading to a visit from The Gelt Gang of Croesus, Midas & Mammon, all hoping for a taste. Sour? Nose was certainly giving off a tanginess & when I leaned in for a sniff, I really got apple vinegar! Phew. My late Pops used to tell of a time, during his annual check-up, that he passed out. In being revived, the smelling salts melted & went up his nose, REALLY reviving him! This had a scent that was going to stick with me for a while. Phew. Mouthfeel was kinda thin & watery, but that is par for the style\'s course. The taste was both tart AND sour! First, my lips puckered from the tartness of the rhubarb but then I got a definite sourness in the hinges of my jaw! Once I got over the initial onslaught & the panic of not having taken my acid reflux meds, I was good. Actually, I had awakened due to pangs of GIRD & took a pill before beginning this beer. Boy howdy, the taste was like sour green apples & I\'m not talking Granny Smiths. This was the sourness of underripe apples that will give you a tummyache. Tart, sour, apple vinegar with a hint of salt for good measure. Phew. This is way outta my comfort zone, which is why I generally eschew Tarts & Sours, but I can still appreciate them when they come my way. I liked the inclusion of both apples & rhubarb, an unusual combination as compared to strawberries & rhubarb. Finish was dry, almost vinous in a dry white wine way.

But New Holland gravitate toward the reasonably sour, briny, wheaten origins that truly make gose unique, albeit with a fruity upgrade.\n\nFoggy gold and topped with a rich cottony froth, the spirited Sour Inc (Apple Rhubarb Gose) leads with a citrusy, cidery, berry-like twang along with the brisk brine of sea air that drift along the nose. Light sweetness captures an essence of sourdough, saltwater taffy and gentle bready sweetness.\n\nAs the ale washes the middle palate, the omnipresent fruit flavors gain command of the tastebuds with the apple character bringing a strong taste of cider, white wine and agave. Underlying fruit flavors that are more natural to the ale support the apple with gooseberry, lime, lemon, passionfruit, yuzu and white grape. Deeper into taste the tangy red berry character of rhubarb shines with redcurrant, strawberry and cranberry. A rounded salinity decorates the late palate along with the sour earthiness of under ripened citrus, matcha tea and margarita.\n\nMedium light in body but reasonably full for sour ale, the moderate attenuation of the beer allows a soft wheaten pillow of malt to continue to temper the effects of acidity from start to finish. a brief aftertaste of salt and sourdough outlasts the linger of fruit but barely while stripping the thirst with ease.\xa01,524 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 30, 2018"", '3.67/5\xa0\xa0rDev -2.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75Decent crisp gose samples on tap at Knickerbocker New Holland.

The aroma does include hints of lemon acidity, gritty wheat grains and brininess, but beyond that it's Citra hops all the way, which in this instance mostly impart notes of lime, berries and indeterminate tropical fruit.\n\nA nice little light brew that blends together sour, salty, and fruity flavours quite deftly. Lemon and lime come through right off the bat, followed up by hints of honeydew melon and passion fruit; these fruitier aspects are underlain throughout the sip by a backbone of grainy wheat malts and persistent sea saltiness. The coriander spice finally makes its appearance on the back end, which also features a short-lived, mild lactic acidity that leads into a salty-sour finish; shades of citrus acidity linger on into the aftertaste. Light in body, with moderate-to-assertive carbonation levels that agitate the tongue continuously. Feels crisp and refreshing to gulp back.\n\nFinal Grade: 4.13, an A-. Nickel Brook's Duplicitous Dry-Hopped Gose is a quality soured ale, with the Citra dry-hopping treatment proving to be a fantastic complement to the base beer's acidity and sea saltiness. I didn't find this one to be overtly, puckeringly sour - the hops, sea salt, coriander and wheat malts all help to distract and dilute the effects of the lactic acid - but I suppose folks new to the sour beer scene might well disagree.

It arrived in a tasting pint, showing a white zinfandel coloring. A frothy, soapy one finger head of white bubbles showed decent retention, and left soft cratered lacing around the glass as it dissipated. No haze or sediment was noted, and carbonation appeared to be active. The nose opened with heavy plastic phenols, cold salt lick, green grassy hops, rose and lilac wet leafiness, pale and wheaty malts, mildly funky metallic yeastiness, rainbow sherbet, sake booziness, white rice, under ripe green pears, cotton candy phenols, vegetal seaweed, dusty drywall, and wet cotton. The following flavor included chlorine chemical zing, soured lemon juiciness, wet wheat, oily hazelnut, raw sourdough dough, plastic and chemical phenols, glass, glue, tart lacto fermentation, acetone, sake, cardboard, soured ginger root, wet and watery celery, white wine vinegar, pale malt dust, nickel, acrylic paint, and ball point pen inkiness. The body was lighter, and carbonation was high, but soft. Wet slurp and smack came atop creamy frothiness, and tight finishing pop. This bled into a high puck, with the mouth left crisply superdried. The abv was appropriate, and the beer drank easily.\n\nOverall, this beer showed excellent sourness and boldness, offering up an ultimately fresh, yet classic, representation of the style. This remained true, with the tartness and saltiness actually curbed and softened by the rosy floral inclusions. This, coupled with the effervescent carbonation made it seem almost like drinking a light, sour version of party champagne. We would definitely toast with this at midnight on New Year’s Eve!! This was the last beer we drank on our final trip to Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, and felt it to be a nice departing uniqueness from them. Always great to try to get exposed to more examples of these goofier, rarer styles in the states.

Blueberry joins the fray late in taste and allows the bready flavors to resemble pancake batter albeit modestly. \n\nLight in body, the beer's maple influence makes the taste slightly more robust and succulent than is usual for sour ale, but it never interferes with the mouthfeel. Tart, crisp and refreshing, a final taste of orange juice and grapefruit juice mixes with maple for a flavor only matched at Bob Evan's.\xa01,398 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 19, 2018""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/25314/328888/

Had my salting of the glass with the cucumber slices helped this? Who knows, but it smelled JUST the way I want a salt & cucumber beer to smell on a hot, humid Summer evening. Mmm. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, kinda watery, but that is par for the style\'s course. Man, it began REALLY salty, then smoothed into CANtaloupe & finally the cucumber asserted itself. The fact that the cucumber only came in at the end indicated that my gilding the lily really did not have a terrific impact on its taste. On the finish, however, I got a lot of salt & cucumber!

Little boozier, little darker, sounds great!\n\nSadly, this beer doesn\'t do it for me. Poured from a 500ml undated bottle on 10/24/19 into a 10oz nonic glass. Color is a reddish murky caramel. Aroma of tootsie roll pops. Yes, a grape tootsie roll pop. Suddenly I was a child again, with a mouth full of post-grape tootsie roll pop saliva. It would be that association that ruined the beer for me. The taste followed the aroma; the same Ritterguts gose structure with its wonderful sweetness to elevate the salt, spices, and acidity. In the Barentoter version, though, the sweetness takes over and becomes an artificial candy kind of flavor that overwhelms the experience for me. It\'s decidedly a winter brew, and the warm snap we\'re currently experiencing in my area doesn\'t help my estimation of the merits of this beer, but even in the proper climatic context I\'m not sure I could shake that weird artificial grape candy association. I love the savory herbaceous quality of the ritterguts original; this is an unwelcome departure.\xa01,226 charactersapplestash, Oct 25, 2019', '4.13/5\xa0\xa0rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75Review: 0,5l bottle of Ritterguts Barentoter, a German\xa0Sour Gose Bock: 6.6% ABV\n\nThe ""beer brewed with spices"" as it says on the bottle.

As the foam recedes, it becomes mottled with both white and pink, leaving pink lacing behind. Plenty of visible effervescence streams.\n\nNose: An interesting aroma. There's definitely that light gose malt base in the background, with the obligatory touch of salinity and minerality, but atop that, there is a definite fruit punch aroma. Almost like cherry anf strawberry gelatin dessert, or a powdered drink. That sort of artificial fruit punch aroma. It isn't terribly complex at all. It smells like what it's advertised as - a fruit punch gose. \n\nPalate: Like the nose, the palate delivers exactly what is promised. It's a fruit punch gose in every sense of the word. What surprised me, is that there is actually quite a bit of gose that comes through. It isn't overpowered by the fruit punch aspect. The first sip reveals a pleasantly, almost surpringly salty zip, followed by a healthy streak of minerality. Perhaps a touch of coriander in there as well. The fruit punch flavour is there, but it's delightfully dry, lacking any and all possible sweetness. This really allows for the salty gose character to shine, without coming across as too artificial. It's like an essence of fruit punch. The fruit punch flavour quickly shifts, and for the duration of the experience, is a background note to the base gose. The finish ramps up the minerality and brings a final kick of salinity, before everything finishes in the cleanest, quietest way possible. The faintest aftertaste of dry fruit punch remains, and lingers on. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: The beer is light, airy, and incredibly crisp. Despite its ultralight body, the texture of the salinity, as well as the fine, lively, seltzer-like effervescence gives it a whole lot of texture, and the beer never even approaches the point of being watery or weak. Everything combined results in a beer that is absurdly refreshing and ridiculously drinkable. \n\nOverall: This is definitely a new-age niche sort of beer. I have torn, opposing opinions when it comes to offerings like this. Personal opinions aside, I have to admit that this is definitely one of the better ones. They kept it quiet, reserved, and preserved the integrity of the base beer, which I find really helps it out. It may be a little unorthodox. It may be a little strange. It may be glowing with the crazy glow of Red 40 Lake dye... But it's an interesting, flavourful, and refreshing twist on a classic and underappreciated style of beer.\xa02,602 charactersSierraNevallagash, Sep 11, 2019"", '3.79/5\xa0\xa0rDev -6%look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75Can.

This is basically a pale wheat where the grain has been allowed to sour before fermentation, producing lactic acid among other things. I love the idea, the problem is that it turned out a little odd. The color is quite strange- very pale straw at the bottom of the glass and darker golden at top. Cloudy throughout, and absolutely no head. You don't see many two-toned beers.

Lemon zest imparts a slight earthiness that adds some character to the light lactic sourness. I enjoy the touch of yeasty funk in the finish.

Some patchy lacing is left behind as the head settles.\n\nStrong dark wheat aromas are detected when I inhale. There is a slight sweetness to the nose as well. Coriander spice can also be smelled.\n\nAn interesting succession of flavors is present in each swallow. It begins with wheat flavors. I can also taste lemon, banana, and coriander. The salt flavoring moves towards the front as I swallow. A slight bit of alcohol is present, along with the wheat, in the aftertaste. Also present here is a touch of sourness.\n\nThe beer has a medium body and slightly above average levels of carbonation. Plenty of coating is left on my tongue. Some stickiness is left on my lips. \n\nThis is a pretty interesting beer, and my first exposure to the style. I find it to be very refreshing, even with the added salt. I think it would be great on a warm day in early fall.

Lightly winey, the beer sings a sangria tune into a finish of lime, crabapple, sourdough and cellar-like mustiness.\n\nFinishing sour, sharp and acutely acidic, the medium light bodied beer lays tracks of sour candies on a medium short aftertaste and an afterglow of musty peach wine.\xa01,209 charactersBEERchitect, Jun 28, 2017""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/31995/288699/

The tartness, succinct flavor and complex fruitiness of their berry soaked gose shows that they are much more than just sugar and cream.\n\nPouring nearly blood red in color, there's no mistaking Wildberry Sorbet's fruits. Siding slightly on the hues of lavender and pink, a frothy wheaten head builds on the rim and draws in the senses with jaw tightening tartness of citrus, wine and succulent berry fruits with a hint of burlap scented must. Hard candy and saltwater taffy frame the beer's candied sweetness upfront with a juiciness usually reserved for fruit punch.\n\nThe acidity of the Germany styled sour ale begins to wash the sweetness and breadiness off of the middle palate as the full berry medley springs to lift. Raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries all make a huge jammy impact on taste but without the sweetness of jellies or jams. Green apple, lime, gooseberry, yuzu and tamarind sourness ensure that the late palate is pleasantly acidic with the berries giving strong impressions of fruited red wines with a light earthen must of sourdough and weathered woods.\n\nMedium bodied for sour ale, the beer's strong acidity is far more sour than is required for gose and its fruit impression overtakes anything resembling wheat, salt or coriander-like, but the beer's hard-to-identify base taste is easily made up for by the acute tartness and the berry punch.\xa01,501 charactersBEERchitect, Jul 16, 2019"", '4.21/5\xa0\xa0rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Appearance - Pours dark reddish color with a huge pink head excellent retention.

Yet there\'s a distinctive watermelon aroma to accompany the citrus as they both carry over to a supple sweetened upstart of confection and light bread.\n\nWith the sweetness proving short-lived, the middle palate dives deeply into the acidity and added fruit as the character of lemon, lime, balsa and watermelon wash over the tastebuds and deliver a high level of refreshing, summery and tangy flavors. And as the acidity easily breaks up the thirst, the beer\'s late taste is of citrusy and perfumy coriander and saltine.\n\nAnd with its light and refreshing palate, the ale is soft and delicate with the melon but firm and brisk with sea salt and limey sourness.

The beer was near clear straw color before I tossed it the very last of the bottle in with the first 95%. Streaks of cloudiness eventually completely hazed the contents. This head lasted as a thin cap most of the pour.\n\nUpon popping the bottle, I got a rush of tart apple with a little funk. Getting into the beer, that impression isn't changed, though the intensity isn't what I'd expect given that first waft. There's a little of the grain - can't say it's wheat or rye, maybe a little more of the latter, combining with the coriander to have a mildly earthy counter to the sour apple, wet wood funkiness. This has a little bit of a farmhouse feel to it.\n\nA blast of lemon tartness first, which fades to Granny Smith apple, including some skin as my palate recovered. A barnyard funk comes in with a light earthy spiciness. Salt is present throughout, but isn't the interesting part of this beer. Not too heavily carbonated, but the combo of tart and light carbonation brings enough to the feel. Perhaps the softening aspect of the salt is in play here as well.\n\nThis is an interesting take, and there's a somewhat Brett-like funk to this beer. It's not huge and loses early against the more sour lactic ingredients. The bottle specifically mentions lactobacillus, but if that's all that's in there, it's coming across differently that it ever has in the past for me. Regardless, the net effect is, as mentioned, a barnyard/farmhouse feel to this beer once the sour aspects let it come out.\n\nA really enjoyable offering. This somehow came across as what I think might be a more classic gose with some new twists involved that aren't focused on fruit of more sourness.

It pours a very hazy straw gold colored body beneath a short lived head of bright white - but it\'s common for sour beers to lose their head almost immediately, so that\'s OK. The aroma is distinctly coconut but there\'s some pineapple in there as well. It\'s OK but not great. It\'s from extract so how good could it be? The flavor expresses piña colada as well, with less coconut than the aroma suggests, and it\'s moderately tart, which is good because any more tartness would have killed it. The salt is also fairly low key, and I think that helps as well. Sitting in the hot sun I could see having one of these. At any other time of the year, probably not.

Initially the raspberry and funk take the center stage, but as the brew warms more, the salt and lactic acid flavors become somewhat more prevalent. Very acidic, but never offputting, as there is just enough extra raspberry blast happening to balance it out. Excellent balance. Simple but effective.\n\nThe mouthfeel is just a shade disappointing compared with everything else about the brew. The carbonation is just a shade weak, and the sweetness, for all of its help on the balance, robs the brew of a bit of its crispness.

Listed at 5.2%.\n\nPours a hazy reddish-pink colour, capped with one finger of fizzy, pale pink-tinged head that has almost completely dissipated within sixty seconds. The surface is totally bare: no cap or collar, not even a smudge of lace. Oh well: that's the way it sometimes goes with gose... at least the colour is attractive. Raspberry fruit and hibiscus flowers are the most notable aspects of the aroma by a considerable margin, with mild lactic acidity and brine being the only other smells of note.\n\nGood stuff, though perhaps not the most assertive gose out there - it has some sourness, obviously, but it integrates so beautifully with the inherent tartness of the raspberry purée that the impact of the overall acidity is lessened (if that makes any sense). The raspberry hits you right off the bat, overlapping with light, wheaty grain and floral hibiscus notes. The lactic acidity peaks towards the finish, with easily-missed suggestions of salt and coriander popping up briefly prior to (and during) an aftertaste of raspberries and lacto sourness. Medium-light in body, with moderate carbonation levels that prickle and scrub the palate softly with each passing sip; very refreshing to drink, too. \n\nFinal Grade: 4.08, an A-. Left Field's Go-Ahead is exactly the sort of beer I'd love to have in my hand at the next Jays' game. I don't think I'd call this an amazing gose, but I do think it's a solid variation upon that theme - as others have noted, this would be a good brew to give to a newbie, as its low saltiness, low-to-moderate sourness and tasty raspberry/hibiscus flavours serve to make this beer much more approachable than the average gose.

Not really I guess, the label reads ""sour session ale made with hand-harvested salt"". Fine by me. It\'s poured a hazy deep golden body beneath a massive head of white foam that shortly dropped to a thin surface covering. There\'s some lacing left behind but not much, although that\'s not bad for it\'s being a sour beer. I really can\'t decide if that\'s a 4 or a 4.25 but I\'ll give it the benefit of the doubt. Just that the head held as long as it did was pretty good, leaving some lace put it over the top. The aroma is mildly fruity and suggests a mild acidity. It\'s surprisingly clean for a sour which is nice as well. As expected, that\'s exactly what you find in the taste except that there\'s also some sweet malt to it and it only comes off as mildly sour. The fruitiness is mainly like apple. With the acidity it reminds me of a bruised apple, or one that\'s fallen from a tree in the orchard and is more fully rotting - don\'t take that in the wrong way though, we\'re not going to eat that apple but you can smell the sweetness as it breaks down and the vinegar as it ferments. There\'s not a lot of bitterness here, the label lists 10 IBUs, but not much is needed anyway. Any more might be too much. It starts acidic, shows its sweetness and fruitiness, and then returns to acidity going into a fairly short and dry finish with some apple and acidity lingering. I guess there\'s a little salt there as well, but they\'ve kept the salt restrained throughout. Good move.It really is ""Just A Pinch"". In the mouth it\'s medium bodied and soft and smooth with a moderate carbonation. I wasn\'t really expecting much from this but I\'m actually impressed.

Still, it has a mostly dry finish.\n\nFeel: It\'s medium leaning towards medium-full in body with a dextrinous edge, maybe even medium-full in body, and gently smooth with a soft, gently effervescent carbonation. \n\nOverall: This is a wonderful cold-weather version of a gosebier, and the only one I know of. The apple-like fruitiness and salt and caramelish malt mix really well. It\'s expensive but at least with this one you get some alcohol for it at 6.6% abv versus their original at 4.7%.

The flavor takes in the soured wheat with a nice salty underneath to once again flush out the citrus sweetness trying to come in. Salty/sour aftertaste is there. More dry/sour than salty and aour in the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a great sessionable feel running all around.

The aroma is tart, fruity, and mineralish. Whoah! It\'s very tart, I wasn\'t expecting that. It\'s a little too sour to be a proper Gose in my opinion, but I guess they called it that because there\'s some salt added. The fruitiness remains. Dry acidic finish. I wish the Rhubarb stood out a little more but it has a hard time fighting the acidity. Light bodied and sharp with acidity and a gently bristling carbonation ~ this beer will wake up your tastebuds! Still pretty decent. As I progress through the pint I\'m becoming more accustomed to the acidity and I get more character out of it ~ I guess as it warms and the carbonation softens a bit as well.

Nose had an interesting twist in that not only was the saltiness quite prevalent, but it also had a grapefruit citrusiness! \n\nIt is the saltiness of the style that always takes me back to my U.S. Navy career & my time underway. We did not do it often enough on my first ship, which is why I requested a swap of orders to my second ship. Aboard the USS Crommelin (FFG-37), we were underway a good bit & I really came into my own as a sailor. I became a boxer & a fighter, a damage CANtrol locker leader & a helicopter crash & rescue team leader. The latter meant that I spent a LOT of time on the flight deck, the fantail or the helo hanger & while food was not supposed to leave the mess decks, they turned a blind eye to those of us who wanted to eat chow on station, al fresco, as it were. I was big on FF&V (fresh fruit & vegetables), eschewing red meat for the most part. As such, I got more than my fair share of FF&V to eat & besides tropical fruit, I loved grapefruit, sometimes taking two (2) whole ones up topside & leisurely eating them in the salt air. Heaven. \n\nGrapefruit & salt! Now, we\'re talkin\'. Great nose! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, a little bigger than usual.

Tangy, succulent and highly refreshing, Nowhere In Particular Brewing can't resist the temptation to give the these two love birds a spin.\n\nBatch #034, or Mango Lime Gose pours with a pale pastel golden color that hinges on peach. Floating the beer lies a stubby white cap that pops excitedly to reveal a rich citronella bouquet. Citrus, orchard fruit, tropical fruit and a faint whiff of the sea drifts across the nose ahead of the soft malty sweetness of saltwater taffy, sourdough and mild agave.\n\nAs the fruit flavors unfold on the middle palate, the full mango and lime characters take over. Mango leads the way with a close backup of orange, papaya and pineapple. Soon after, the lime steps up with its counterparts of cider, white wine, lemon and yuzu. Trending sharply but cleanly sour, a gentle earthiness of burlap offers a soft earthy note while the sea salt adds an off-salty roundness to the late palate.\n\nLight in body but remaining creamy and drying, the tartness of fruit and fermentation cleanses the palate with ease, ushering in a high degree of refreshment, drinkability, a quick aftertaste and sheer enjoyment. The ale never looses its identifiable mango or lime flavor as its sure to be a great choice for sangria and bellini lovers as well as those of beer.\xa01,376 charactersBEERchitect, Sep 19, 2019"", '4.1/5\xa0\xa0rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.512 oucne can into tulip glass, canned in 6/2019.

Best before: 07/2014. 50cl brown glass bottle with unbranded pry-off pressure cap acquired at Hopfen und Malz in Berlin, Germany and served cold into a Berliner Kindl Weisse glass in me friend's gaff in Berlin. Expectations are high; I don't think a Germany brewery makes a gose unless they're confident, and gosebiere seem to be their specialty.\n\nSide-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.\n\nNo bubble show forms as it's poured.\n\nHEAD: Pours almost entirely foam. Four fingers wide. White colour. Nicely soft and fluffy. Decent consistency; it could be far more full. Billowing. Recedes fully within about 10 minutes - which is quite respectable, even at this average an ABV. Leaves spots of lacing, but nothing even or consistent.\n\nBODY: Cloudy pale yellow. Milky. Average vibrance. Translucent but nontranparent. No floating yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible; it's a clean albeit obviously unfiltered beer. Looks healthy.\n\nSeems a bit overcarbonated; it did gush a bit on opening and the head is overly foamy, but I'm optimistic. It's an apt appearance for a gose, but not perhaps a great one. Not unique or special, but then how many (authentic) gosebiere are really brewed?\n\nAROMA: Lemon zest, clean barley, sea salt, and faint hints of soapy notes. Pleasant clean wheat. It's pleasantly surprising, and I'm looking forward to trying it. The light lacto-induced sourness could be (and I think should be) more prominent, but that might just be the sour-fiend in me. I'm not picking up on the coriander, but then my nose is broken (all apologies). It does have a lovely albeit subtle citrusy twang to it, which seems to suit the salt well. Light floral hop character.\n\nA pleasant aroma of mild strength. I'm really looking forward to trying this. A nice aroma for a gose, though I admit the saltiness does still give me pause.\n\nNo alcohol or other off-notes are detectable.\n\nTASTE: The body is simple yet effective - flaked wheat and clean barley. The salt is tame but complementary, and works well with the subtle coriander - though I would like more coriander, or even some cilantro. Floral hop notes. Lemongrass. Light citrusy twang. The lactic sourness - while more timid than would be ideal - complements the citrusy twang nicely. Balanced and enjoyable; this is one of the better gosebiere I've had in recent memory. Not complex or intricate, but it's got nuance and good subtlety. Built well. It's cohesive, but not gestalt.\n\nAbove average depth of flavour. Average duration and intensity of flavour.\n\nTEXTURE: Smooth, wet, medium-bodied, aptly thick, and delightfully soft. Pleasing and approachable, with a great overall presence on the palate. Well-carbonated. Complements the taste quite nicely.\n\nNot oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, or harsh.\n\nOVERALL: This is a stand-out gose for me, but I do regret not having had more beers in the style - though how many are there really to have? This is extremely drinkable (perhaps in spite of its saltiness) and I'd definitely get it again. Better than I remember the gosebiere in Leipzig being. This is my new benchmark for the style, but still I can envision a far better offering - ideally with more citrus, more lactic notes and sourness, and perhaps some cilantro. Definitely worth picking up. I'm glad I got to try it. \n\nLow B\xa03,363 characterskojevergas, Jun 04, 2014"", '3.7/5\xa0\xa0rDev -0.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5Half litre bottle.

Of course, there are two significant distinctions between this and a Wit: the assertive sourness and the mineral contribution of the salt. Unlike the other Goses, the salt here simply provides a mineral quality as opposed to an actual saline flavor. While I personally prefer Döllnitzer, this was a very enjoyable beer and worth trying should the opportunity present itself.\xa01,069 charactersWindigstadt, Jan 15, 2009""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/19123/47289/

Take off, eh? This is one of my FAVORITE holidays of the year since it provides me with the impetus to a) drink CANned CANadian beer ISO The CANQuest (tm); b) watch hockey (either pre-recorded games or movies, like ""Slapshot""; c) watch ""Strange Brew""; d) eat some beaver & e) parade nekkid in the street while waving a CANdian flag. 2017 was their 150th Anniversary so I pulled out all of the stops, using sparklers & firecrackers as accoutrements, which was attention-getting, to say the least. The local CANstabulary was bemused & amused as they led me away, but I was less-than-thrilled with the 1st & 2nd degree burns, especially to my sensitive bits! Needless to say, I have scaled back since then. \n\nFrom the CAN: ""100% Gluten Free*100% Great Beer""; ""Ingredients: Water, Millet, Buckwheat, Quinoa, Lime, Lemon, Grapefruit, Sea Salt, Hops, Yeast"". \n\nI had ""Rush\'s Greatest Hits"" playing on YouTube as I Crack!ed open the vent. I really liked their Witbier & now I was looking forward to what seemed to be a natural. I agitated this one in the CAN so a quick C-Line Glug was the next order of the day. It puffed up really quickly to form just under two fingers of foamy, fizzy, soapy, off-white head with moderate retention that soon reverted to wisps. Color was a downright cloudy Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9). Nose smelled like salted grapefruit! I love grapefruit. This had all the earmarks of a winner. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, but not out of spec for the style. OMFG, was this tart! Taste was obviously driven by all of the citrus fruits, but it was marred by the nuttiness of buckwheat. 8=( It is a trade-off in crafting a gluten-free beer that buckwheat, millet & sorghum are needed to create fermentable sugars, but the taste of buckwheat is a specialized taste, one that PapPap Kirsch did not pass on to me. Other than that, it was deeply citrusy-tart with a beautiful saltiness. Finish was quite tart & dry & a perfect fit for a hot, humid Summer\'s evening. I have to downgrade it when rating to style, but don\'t let that deter you from trying this one.

Okay, truth be told, I find that many sours that try to overwhelm you with an unnecessary, excessive amount of fruit puree are nigh undrinkable. So, I'm very appreciative of the restraint, here. A smooth, light sweetness rounding out snippets of dough, wheat, curdled lemon and salt join the grape fruitiness through the crispish finish.\n\nMouthfeel: Medium-light body.

Like a vile of your blood sitting in a test tube at the hospital when you're being diagnosed with a blown mind after seeing this insane looking beer. Two fingers rose petal pink foamy head sit atop, slowly reducing, but never quite going away. \n\nNose is a whole bag full of mixed red berries. Strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, cherry, currant, boysenberry, poisonberry, mullberry, etc... a little bit of pale malt action underneath, a little touch of creaminess, that reminds me a lot of lactose beers, and also just also tiny whiff of salt - the way a Gose should be.\n\nPalate greets you immediately with a fairly hefty malt bill. Very atypical of a Gose. The malt base is like that of a fluffy NEDIPA. After the malt sweetness, then the berry character comes in. Definitely interprets as blackberry, and I can see currant too. There's a big pinch of salt, and I like that very much. The hefty malt and fruity berries make sure the salt cannot become overbearing. I keep thinking I'm tasting lactose, but I think it's just the massive malt backbone. It's an odd milky flavor. The tiniest bit of tart zing sits in the mix as well. 0.5 on a sale to 10. Lingering finish of strawberries and cream.\n\nMouthfeel is thick, soft, and a little creamy. Wet. Not dry at all. It's very heavy for a Gose, especially at less than 5% ABV. The body is what prevents this from being exceptional for me. I want a Gose to be light, crisp, and snappy - something that can almost replace a glass of water on a hit summer day. This is not that. This feels like a big New England double IPA. It's heavy and almost chewy. Comes across like a sour IPA with lactose. In fact, it reminds me so much of HH's Don't Microwave It, Don't Boil It (Boysenberry). \n\nOverall, this one is odd. It's a little salty, yes, but that's about the only Gose trait it has going for it. It's heavy, thick, malty, and it just has this milky off note to it that I find very distracting. I think I'd be slightly less disappointed if this were labeled something else, but it's calling itself a Gose, and therefore, I'm assessing it as such.\xa02,235 charactersSierraNevallagash, Dec 16, 2018"", '4.02/5\xa0\xa0rDev +0.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4Bought a can at the Beer Shop in East Longmeadow, MA.

Taste is inoffensive, a bit of malt flavor without being too sweet, with very low IBU hops toward the end. It’s a smooth drinker, so it would be no problem tossing back several. Overall, probably right on the money as far as the target demographic goes (people who like to drink beer while spending time on and around the water).

About two big fluffy fingers of foamy white head. No lacing to speak of, but it looks pretty nice. Very cloudy & full of sediment on the last pour.\n\nS - The aroma doesn't offer up much, aside from that doughy trademark yeast that I've come to really love about Only Child beers. Mild prickly carbonation presence, but nothing that would suggest any sour or tartness.\n\nT - Taste follows the nose - bready, doughy, wheaty, & yeasty above anything else. No real sour or tartness, like on the nose, and I'm not picking up on anything I would really describe as salty.\n\nM - The feel is crisp, smooth, & clean on the finish. Light-bodied with good carb.\n\nOverall, I think it's nice, but it's certainly not a prime example of a gose. What we have is good, but if we could maybe up the sour next time, this one could be great.

Minerally without any olfactory indicators of tart or sour.\n\nTaste is a little more balanced with a mild lacto tartness cutting the heavy handed salt brine. Minerally and wheaty base, saltine crackers, the salinity adds some body but at the expense of the flavor. Tartness is meek and mild, not really enough to give it a quenching character.

The carbonation is aggressive and with big bubbles rising quickly to the top of the liquid, while the lacing is modest overall.....some small patches of protein cling before slowly sliding to the abyss.\n\nS- I detect huge citrus fruit (grapefruit/pomello/lemon zest), along with bittering hops, grainy barley and wheat, floral aromas (roses do come to mind), some spicy heat from the ginger root used, and the finish is clean and full of hops again. Nice overall!\n\nT- Ok this is interesting to say the least......initial flavors of citrus flesh, floral notes, and theres an underlying soapiness that seems to take me back to my childhood (soapy bathwater).

What the what?\n\nThis beer pours a hazy, pale golden straw colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, finely foamy, and mildly creamy bone-white head, which leaves some high-flying streaky lace around the glass as it very slowly abates.\n\nIt smells of rather pungent rose water (like my Mom's old bathroom), zesty ginger spice, some muddled pale and wheaten cereal malt, a hint of earthy yeastiness, and some plain leafy, weedy, and further floral green hop bitters. The taste is gritty and bready pale malt, some grainy wheatiness, more estery rose petals (bordering on Turkish Delight), white saltine crackers, lemongrass, musty ginger root, and more tame leafy, herbal, and piney verdant hoppiness.\n\nThe carbonation is fairly active, if in a plain-Jane frothy manner, the body a so-so medium weight, and mostly smooth, if attar perfume is your idea of a good mouthfeel time. It finishes off-dry, a lingering mixed maltiness tamping down on the rose and ginger essences, to all our good fortune.\n\nOverall, I can't complain that this brewery didn't bring their A game in providing the promised flavours - I mentioned Turkish Delight earlier (which I could really go for right about now), and I stand by that, if in a much less sweeter version than yer typical bulk aisle purchase.

So this doesn't excite me overly much, but it is well done and is true to the stated intentions on the label, so credit where credit is due. \n\nFlavour brings a sharp acrid tartness back to the forefront. The same slick salinity creeps in here, but is a compliment here, as opposed to the overwhelming (and frankly unpleasant) presence I've found in some other goses. The tart is balanced with an almost juicy sweetness that isn't really sweet, more just a juicy foil for the tart front. The beets don't make much of an appearance in this phase of the experience as it's all tart n' juicy. Almost more like the tart aspect of early season berries, but accentuated and with the sweeter bits toned down.\n\nBrightly effervescent, I'm enjoying this quite a bit and it's perfect for this turning weather and early early onset summer (we need more spring!) as the days have been hot and bright of late.

The rhubarb is rather subtle providing just a flash of tartness.

It's wild how Westbrook manages to nail the 'pie' aspect of their pie gose series through the usage of wheat. The strawberries are once again more cooked seedy and jammy than fresh berries, which I suppose makes sense as they'd be cooked in a pie. There is pleasant tartness from the rhubarb. Lingering more on the lips than anything is some nice almost drying salinity. It really does taste like summer time for me baking strawberry rhubarb pies and cobblers fresh from the oven with some vanilla ice cream melting on it.\n\nM - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, medium bodied.

Great color and awesome retention, one of the cleanest strawberry aromas and flavours I had in a beer in years and years.

Westbrook Key Lime Pie Gose is my go to trade for summer crusher due to it's intense tartness and acidity, however, I think I like the actual execution of this beer more. It is definitely a dessert beer thanks to the amount of strawberry and probably not one I could sit down and put back can after can, so that edge still goes to Key Lime Pie Gose.

I don\'t see any dates on the bottle, but I can say that my wife picked this up for me while in Portland a couple of weeks ago.\n\nAppearance: holy guacamole, that\'s an interesting look. Salmon pink with a finger of frothy ivory foam; there\'s a pink tinge to the head that might be due to just the body\'s mighty hazy pink character. Whatever the case may be, I like it.\n\nSmell: very wheaty; there\'s a maltiness and slight sourness that just read as ""beery"" to me. The berries/fruit are kind of disguised here.\n\nTaste: good berry flavor; there\'s a good sweetness and a prickly acidic berry quality. Raspberry and blackberry definitely come to mind here; good, if a bit muddled.\n\nMouthfeel: medium body with a good level of carbonation and a good creaminess for the style. I quite like it.\n\nOverall: this beer is obviously all over the place for me. The smell is rough and unpromising; the flavor has a lot going for it but is muddled, and the texture is quite nice. Overall, this is definitely a beer worth trying if you get your hands on it, but it\'s not worth going crazily out of your way to do so.\xa01,155 charactersflagmantho, Mar 07, 2018']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35612/328970/

Similarly, there's a quick buzz of visible carbonation at first, but it stops almost as soon as you’re done pouring. A little disappointing in the appearance category - this looks flat and almost sad.\n\nS: Pilsner malts, light lactic tartness. Some fruity yeast esters – a mild Belgian yeastiness with apples up front. Not off-putting, but this doesn’t much smell like a gose.\n\nT: Light lactic tartness over cracker malts with a moderate pilsner character as well. Mild lemony citric acid, coriander, and then more yeast esters that just don’t belong here, and lend an apple or pear flavor. Maybe a very mild salinity, but mild enough I think I would have missed it if wasn’t looking for it. More fruitiness at the swallow.\n\nM: A light body, with low carbonation sensation (though not as flat as the appearance suggested). Low alcohol presence.\n\nO: Despite what the name (and can) indicated, this just isn’t a gose-style ale at all. The Belgian-type yeast flavors shouldn’t be there, it’s not very tart, and the salt is largely missing. I would certainly prefer without the pilsner malt flavors, but that’s personal preference. It’s not undrinkable, but I won’t be drinking it again. Also, I wouldn’t recommend it if you are looking for a gose.

The Ginger bite is up front, but the flavor plays second fiddle. In some respects, there's an aspect of a radler here, but any sweetness is replaced by ginger spice, enhancing the tart aspect.

The characteristic sourness I expect from a Gose is noticeably absent, as is any hint of coriander. There\'s a bit of rye flavor and dryness in the finish.

I love this style because it's easy to enjoy in all aspects and that was true with this as well. No, it wasn't strong but nothing of this sort is and the taste and mouthfeel were more than satisfying enough for me on this mild summer night!\n\nThe pour to this was a dark blood orange with enough sheen to it to serve as reminder that this wasn't an unfiltered IPA or anything of the sort. A nice, loud head topped it off but the liveliness of it faded quickly as the bubbles settled before I had a chance to fully admire this beer's look. Never saw lacing like the one this left behind as it was a cross between a spider web and a tan, stringy mess that looked like it was violently tossed against the inside of my pint glass. Lots of sea salt, blood orange, lactic acid, and yeast in the nose with the funky, acetic tone emerging even stronger in the taste. Blood orange juice, berry tartness, citrus tang, and lively bubbles rounded this out as there was plenty of life to this, for a beer that almost felt like a sour...\n\nOf course, the booze was light as this was quite easy to quaff. A good amount of fruit lingered throughout as the malt was quite basic and the sea-salt was present, but never overpowering. Not the best brew from The Veil but there was enough to like here and those looking to have a Leipzig Gose for the first time would be wise to reach for this.

Aromas of some bready malts and certainly some wheat along with lime notes and also a hint of lactose. A very similar flavor profile is found here, with a nice bready malt and wheat backbone for the flavor profile that's followed by a very nice lime zest that adds just the right amount of tangy sourness and a nice hint of lactose. The addition of the lactose is certainly interesting, but I feel it sort of masks/diminishes the other flavors a bit. Just a slight touch of herbal and floral hops.

Thanks!Gose to Mexico...is one of the most vibrantly colored beers I have ever seen. As a matter of fact it looks like red Kool Aid, it's that bright. Good clarity runs throughout as carbonation streams to the surface from a from a few spots at glass bottom. A crackling, active foam rises to a finger in height on the pour, it's also tinted red, but eventually fades a a surface skimming. Interesting looking beer, this is.\n\nIt's funny, with a vibrant color I can't help but expect something different in the nose but what I get is gose all the way with a backend fruity tartness. Tangy, soured wheat leads it off and is the star of this show. A touch of ground coriander pops up in the middle before the additions come in. Wet stone and a softly metallic character, iron mostly, come through thanks to the addition of lacto while the prickly pear adds a soft, yet unspecific, fruity sweetness. A little popcorn-y with a touch of diacetyl.\n\nThat wheat twang hits off the bat, slightly soured and delicious. Faint coriander runs the middle along with hard water. Some of that minerality and wet stone comes into play again on the palate, and I like it. The salt kicks in on the finish, nice and even handed. There is a touch of diacetyl here and there but it tends to clear up as the beer warms. Again, the prickly pear brings some vague fruity sweetness, and a little earthiness, to the finish. \n\nThe body sits squarely between light and moderate with a zippy carbonation that keeps the whole moving. There is a coating quality to this beer which is odd for such a light body. A little tartness hits the sides and back of the tongue. Honestly, it leaves a film of sorts after each drink. It's easily drinkable and highly refreshing but that film kind of throws me a bit.\n\nGose to Mexico... is a good beer from the folks at Hailstorm and Arrowhead. It's bright and refreshing. A good summer sipper for sure and the 6-pack format doesn't hurt either. A touch tart, a touch fruity, and salty enough to get your salivary glands working in anticipation of the next sip. Certainly worth a shot.\xa02,186 charactersjoe1510, May 01, 2016""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/34315/227498/

They inquired of me as to whether I had gotten any of Riepstine\'s Pub\'s CANned beers & when I replied that I had recently reviewed the IPA, they sent me some of the others, including this one. That\'s pretty cool! Also, many thanks to this site for an almost-immediate approval of the pic. \n\nFrom the CAN: ""\'Where It\'s All About The Beer!\'""\n\nThe CANQuest (tm) is really shifting gears now! If you look at my reviews, I have gone from APAs to AIPAs to DIPAs and now I am getting ready to segue into a bunch of beers from the same brewer (a horizontal), but I need to lead up to it first.\n\nThe Crack! opened onto yet another brimful craft CAN and I could not CANtain my excitement. An inverted Glug and my glass began rapidly filling with a CANbination of liquid & foam to the point that I felt CANpelled to back off. Settling, I was left with two fingers of foamy, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5). Nose smelled of sea salt and I am speaking from experience. I put in 15.25 years in the US Navy before taking early retirement and 9.5 of that was aboard four different ships. Sea spray/sea salt has an unmistakable scent that is completely unlike common iodized table salt. Standing in the bow, getting the spray in your face, in your nostrils & in your sinuses is a smell that will always linger. The coriander gave it a flowery, black pepper bite. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, much bigger in the mouth than I anticipated. The taste was salty, as advertised. Hoo boy, was it salty! Ever been swimming in the ocean and gotten a mouthful of water? That\'s what this was like. It was saturated with sea salt. I wonder if the Germans brew it with this much salt. It was like gargling with salt water. Finish was dry (duh!), salty and immensely refreshing. The low ABV makes it a definite CANdidate for the summer cooler and CANbined with its thirst-quenching nature, it would be great during the summer. The only CANcern would be the taste. I do not mind salt, but it may not be for everyone.\xa02,121 characterswoodychandler, Jan 29, 2016', ""4.25/5\xa0\xa0rDev +25.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 4Poured into a standard pint glass: color is gold, head is brighter white but dissipates quickly to a feint ring.\n\nSmell is near brine with some fresh cracked coriander and a touch of biscuit - gose all the way.\n\nTaste is a little tart, then saltiness overtakes this brew - one of the few goses' I've had where you can actually taste the salt, which i think is the intention of the brew.

Later on, after the sediment is introduced, it looks beige and has the complexion of wet sand. It has such a faded, almost bleached tone that you'd think it was left in the sun for a month. A light effervescence is the only sign of life. \n\nOnly after it warms up considerably is there any evidence of coriander on the nose. Such an aromatic ingredient aught to be more apparent, or so I'd like it to be. There's also nothing in the bouquet to indicate the style's patented sourness either. Everything so far is very subdued. \n\nThere's enough protein in this grain bill to muddy-up the complexion but not to weigh down the mouthfeel. This drinks as light as it looks, with delicate apricot and orange zest flavours and only a light, fleeting trace of coriander. Many sips taste of stale grain resembling dry bread or plain crackers.\n\nToo much salt is worse than too little, granted, but this really lacks in that saline/mineral presence that distinguishes the style. Same goes for the characteristic sourness; this recipe doesn't offer nearly enough of that salty/sour interplay that makes Gose so incredibly refreshing. \n\nIf you ask me, Local 7 Session Gose was brewed with too gentle a hand and isn't exactly true to style. Its somewhat tequila-like floral and citrus notes are pleasant but don't make up for the lack of spice, salt and sourness that define the style. Mind you, these judgements are reflective of personal preference.\xa01,500 charactersbiegaman, Jul 24, 2015""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/34672/174528/

Served slightly chilled and reviewed from notes.\n\nThis gose has a lightly hazed, goldenrod-coloured body, capped off with one finger of sparkling white foam that proceeds to fizzle away within a couple of minutes. A ring of froth continues to cling to the perimeter, but there's nary a smudge of lace to be seen. The aroma is low-key yet inviting, with lemon rind and zestiness overlapping with some light lactic acidity. There are also faint suggestions of lime and lychee, as well as a salty, briney quality to the nose.\n\nIt tastes of bready, wheaty sweetness, with notes of grain husk, passion fruit and grapefruit coming through mid-sip alongside the aforementioned lemon-lime tartness. That lactic acid sourness is also present, but in a less potent and/or central capacity than in many of the other goses I've had, which may make this more approachable than most. Hints of berries, lime and coriander linger into the fruity, slightly salty aftertaste. Medium in body, with average carbonation levels that impart a small amount of crispness to what is otherwise a rather smooth, slick-feeling light ale. For that reason, this is not as refreshing as I tend to expect this style to be - though I suppose it's nearly as sessionable.\n\nFinal Grade: 3.69, a B grade. Black Isle's Anything Gose is good enough, but I don't think I'd call it great. The citra hops were a fine choice, with their citrusy, fruity qualities working out quite nicely, particularly on the nose. However, the sourness is definitely a bit lacking in intensity, and the mouthfeel is also not as spritzy and thirst-quenching as I'd prefer. Worth taking a flyer on; I enjoyed my two bottles and may be back for more, though I'm not in a big hurry to do so.\xa01,840 charactersthehyperduck, May 16, 2018"", '3.52/5\xa0\xa0rDev -2.5%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5330 ml bottle served cold into a pint glass.

A half finger of head rests on top and has some modest staying power.\n\nSmell - Hints of lemon and something kind of sweet in behind, maybe a little like gooseberry or blueberry. Plenty of wheat in there as well and hints of coriander.\n\nTaste - Hints of tartness, a touch sour, but overwhelmingly greainy with bits of lemon too. Not as tart nor as salty as many in the style, and has a little bit of fruity sweetness in play as well. Kind of like gose meets pale lager with a fruity sweetness in the finish. Interetsing and stuill refershing, but not quite as much as a traditional lemon forward gose is.\n\nMouthfeel - Medium-light bodied, good carbonation, a touch chalky on the finish.\n\nOverall - Anything Gose, while a playful pun or words, is a fine attempt at a gose, but lacks a little bit extra salt and lemon bite to make this the thirst quenching brew it desires to be.

A paper thin collar is the only thing that sticks around for more than two minutes' time; no lacing, either. Falls a bit flat visually, and the aroma doesn't improve matters much - it's extremely faint, and remains that way even as the brew warms. I'm getting subtle notes of lemon, lime and wheat husk, and maybe some salty ocean air, but I can't convince myself that anything else is there.\n\nFortunately it does taste a fair bit better than it smells. Wheaty grain husk and some crackery pale malt sweetness provide the appropriate backup, with citrusy flavours of lime juice and lemony tartness coming through clearly by mid-sip. The lime almost seems to overtake or assume the role of any lactic acidity that may be present. Hints of black tea; it finishes with some lingering lemon-lime tartness, which give way to a salty aftertaste that takes a few moments to reveal its mild black pepper spiciness. Light in body, with moderately assertive carbonation that briskly prickles the palate, working nicely in conjunction with the peppercorn spiciness. Crisp and pretty refreshing, in addition to being very easy to toss back.\n\nFinal Grade: 3.49, a B-. Lake of Bays' Spin Dive Summer Gose is a better stab at this style than I expected it to be. The lime is a nice addition, blending seamlessly with the baseline salty-sourness of the gose style, and I am also partial to the black pepper notes that come through on the back end. A good beginner's gose; the low levels of lactic acidity (largely subsumed by the lime sourness) are unlikely to turn off the newbies. I'd recommend giving it a shot as soon as possible, while the cans are still fresh, instead of putting it off until August and taking your chances with old stock.\xa01,961 charactersthehyperduck, May 17, 2018"", ""4.75/5\xa0\xa0rDev +24.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Straight up one of the best goses out of Canada.

One centimetre of loose, bubbly white head is produced atop, then proceeds to fall apart within two minutes' time; a frothy collar of bubbles sticks around afterwards, paired with a scant coat of lace. Smells quite vegetal, earthy, and a bit dirty... I'm getting an almost mushroom-like odour, punctuated by faint hints of raspberry and rhubarb. I was expecting a much fruitier aroma based on its appearance, so the oddness of the bouquet kind of threw me for a loop.\n\nThere's a lot going on here, and not all of it is complementary, so the first few sips left my taste buds a bit, um, disoriented. There some grainy malts and gritty, crackery wheat buried within the profile, but the rhubarb is what carries things along, remaining dominant through to the tail end of the sip. Suggestions of apricot and black plum come through, with hints of raspberry, blackberry and earthy pine resin finally surfacing at the finish, lasting on into a moderately fruity-sweet, weakly salty aftertaste. Slightly tannic quality, which I must assume is related to the black raspberry. Light-medium in body, with spritzy carbonation that sprightly tickles the surface of the palate, giving a bit of prickliness to this brew's generally smooth mouthfeel.\n\nFinal Grade: 3.35, a B-. De Berry's Treasure is a strange one - more of a fruit beer than a gose, with the sea salt playing a rather minor role overall (in comparison to the rhubarb and, to a lesser extent, the raspberry), and virtually no sourness whatsoever. I don't entirely dislike this beer, but its disparate flavours do not come together as cohesively as I'd hoped - I don't know if it's the hops and the rhubarb or what, but some aspects of the profile simply seem to clash in an unappealing way.

The foam snap, crackles, and pops to attention. A couple fingers high. It's bubbly and fizzy before receding fairly quickly to nothing but a swirl. Could use a little more retention but this beer seems to lean more toward the sour than most so it's to be expected. With all that said, it looks good.\n\nThe nose is bright and vibrant taking on a lactic sour edge. Pineapple yogurt is the first thing that comes to mind. Deep pulls and I'm hit with that rustic wheat twang that's oh so inviting. The wheat base of this beer is like standing in a field when the breeze kicks up. A couple swirls brings forth orange peel, a hint of grapefruit and a touch of tropicals. This beer really opens up as it warms a bit.\n\nThe tropical fruitiness is more upfront in the flavor profile than the nose suggested. The middle brings more of that lactic pineapple yogurt tartness. The wheat tends to come through mostly on the finish. Freshly cracked and rustic with a nice twang. I get a touch of salt on the swallow but not much. It' bright and mildly acidic. The dry hopping adds a unique fruitiness to an already good beer.\n\nTransient seems to do a very good job when it comes to dialing in the carbonation and weight of their beers. This particular concoction is on the lighter side of the spectrum with an aggressive, tongue tingly carbonation that brings frothiness to the body. Tartness lingers on the front of the tongue and inside of the cheeks while a soft saltiness lingers long after the swallow. The more I drink the drier the finish becomes. Very nice.\n\nDry Hopped Salarium is a fine beer from Transient. It's uniquely fruity with a solid wheat base and dialed in mouthfeel. Is it an improvement over original Salarium? Tough to say, it's a different animal all together, more tart and much more fruity. I would pick up this version again in the future.\xa01,994 charactersjoe1510, Nov 18, 2016""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/34258/256752/

But Rhinegeists Dodo lands in the ream where both types meet.\n\nDodo's pour is bright and lemony straw, but also somewhat milky with its haze. As a delicate stark-white head springs to the surface, it soon dissolves to a necklace around the edge, succumbing to its own acidity. Its tangy, lemony aroma is backed with sour green fruits and hints of fresh baking bread. Sweet and sour in its initial taste, the beer's bready structure keeps the pilsner sweetness and wheaten body elevated... at first.\n\nBut the angel-food cakiness and confectioner's sweet begins to dissolve on the middle palate and the sourness rises. Lactic in its nature, the piquant tang of lemon, lime, crabapple, white grape and kiwi all weave into a refreshing, sprite taste. Unlike the more sour versions, the taste retains its wheat structure and keeps a semblance of balance before its minerally, salty, perfumy finish.\n\nWith a savory saline character to round out the flavors and to give the fruit flavors and bread structure a brighter, more robust character; the medium-light ale is balanced with a strong chardonnay tartness, a dry finish and an echo of citrusy perfume in aftertaste.\xa01,399 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 09, 2015""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/31995/194060/

The head is short, white, and fizzy. No head retention or lacing.\n\nAroma: The beer smells like vegetables in general. It smells a bit like a Bloody Mary but without the spice or tomato. There is a strong cucumber scent to the beer. As odd as the beer smells it is actually quite remarkable and clear. There is a bit of parsley scent to the beer. It is a crazy smelling beer but it has a nice quality to it.\n\nTaste: Up front there is this tart and slightly sour bite that puckers the lips with a tart lemon and a bit of sour raspberry flavor. Soon after this there is a cooling sensation and a flavor of cucumbers. Very clean and enjoyable flavors.\n\nMouthfeel: The beer has a very pronounced and tart opening that is quickly swept away with a cooling sensation. Carbonation feels low.\n\nOverall: This is a pretty awesome beer. The name of the beer is ""QUICK PICKLE"" but it says that it is a ""Gose brewed with Carrots and Cucumbers."" It really tastes like cucumbers and not pickles. It\'s a very refreshing beer to drink and it\'s the kind of beer you just have to try for yourself. I could see this being an extremely popular alternative to the standard Bloody Mary or Mimosa. I really enjoyed it and I\'m very impressed by it.

The sourness is very mild, hardly present.\n\nFlavor: impressive. This is a mellow beer, but is so well layered. Salt first, immediately followed by the tart and coriander, which then transitions to the plum. Weldwerks’ brewers delivered on all of the flavors described on the label, and all of the flavors appear as a separate layer. The plum flavor is so delicate but exhibited so well in the finish. This beer is certainly not fruit forward; the plum flavor is captured so well, however. The plum flavor conjures thoughts of a spring garden and flower blossoms. \n\nMouthfeel: light-medium, just a wee tad heavier than I expected or prefer. Very drinkable, though. Gassy-carbonation; soda-like.\n\nOverall: this is a beer that is well executed at every metric. This is one of the best in styles that I’ve tried to date (fruited or otherwise).

Lemony with ironlike acidity that could go awry, except for the earthy wheat keeping things in balance. Both puckering and mouthwatering at the same time.

There isn't really enough fruit flavor or sour power to slot this beer into the new-school gose (like Anderson Valley), but it has more fruit and salt than a true German style.

A gose type with lime juice and plums and salt all happening it, and quite a bit more complex overall than a lot of these ever are, even if the yeast element is relatively minimal. The lactic sourness is mild and its clean, the acidity of the lime seems higher than any from the fermentation profile, and the plum has enough sweetness left in its fleshy ripeness to balance this and keep it from being aggressive or anything at all. A light candied note to it but not sugary, just like a flavor concentration, a floral complexion too, a really neat freshness that I like, and just a little brine thing in the finish from the salt, but less than is common in the style. Refreshing because of the high carbonation, interesting layers of flavor through it, and overall something we all really liked.

Umm... okay. I mean, I\'ve already accepted that 2019 is truly the year we fell into an alternate universe that is less-than-stellar, but there are some good things about it, and one of those is that the beer this year has been crazy good. Will BS follow that path? Or will this be pure bull...?\n\nPours like a fruit smoothie with a dense, deep red/garnet color that stays completely opaque and unmoving throughout. Topped off with a really fluffy head of pinkish foam, this looks... interesting. Reminds me a lot of an even more saturated version of Cantillon\'s Zwanze a few years ago. I\'m pretty sure it won\'t be as good as that beer was, but it seems like it\'s gonna damn well try to be (within what can be expected from this being a fruited ""imperial gose,"" anyway).\n\nThis is brewed with blackberries, blueberries, and elderberries, so obviously a big component of the nose is a rather sizable jammy berry component. I\'m actually pretty surprised of a couple things here, though. First off, there\'s a surprising coriander element here, and I appreciate that. It really helps drive home the point that this isn\'t just a fruited sour, but it\'s supposed to have at least something tangentially in common with the gose style. Granted there\'s also sea salt in here, but that\'s tough to smell, so I\'ll have to wait to sip this to figure out if it plays a role. The second interesting aside is that this actually smells like there\'s vanilla beans in it, but the label says nothing about lactose or vanilla. It does give me that ""smoothie"" vibe, though.\n\nI\'m kinda taken aback by how well this drinks and how nicely all of these flavors come together. Cowthulhu has a definite berry jam flavor profile, of course, but there are slight nuances, and it\'s not super-sour... it\'s just smooth and fruity in an endearing, well-built way. I pick up the somewhat grassy and funky note from the blueberries, for example, while there is a light dose of sweetness from the elderberries. This definitely has a mineral component as well, and I\'m grateful for that as I was grateful for the coriander in the nose. These slight but important elements give this beer some gravitas and seem to indicate that this isn\'t just some goofy maximalist fruit beer. There\'s panache here, and actual brewing talent to boot.

It is like the old saw: I read where heavy and repeated imbibing CAN have negative effects on one\'s health, so I gave up ... on reading!\n\nFrom the CAN: ""Gose brewed with Prickly Pear""; ""\'Beer has virtue only in giving its victims more of the good-natured stupidity of the idiot and less of the demoniac frenzy of the madman.\' - Lyman Beecher""; ""Nino’s Prickly Pears is inspired by the enchanting world of Sicily, the birthplace of Dock Street founder Rosemarie Certo. Pours a deep pink with a similarly-tinged white head. A mild aroma of tart fruit leads to clear flavors of prickly pear and hints of watermelon. Light bodied and dry, the slight sweetness in this beer is balanced by a tart finish typical of the Gose style. Nino’s Prickly Pears is an escape from winter; evocative of semitropical Sicily and its scorching sun."" \n\nI beCAN by lightly inverting this beer while still in the CAN since haziness is okay in the style. My Crack! of the vent gave me some light foaming so my efforts had paid off. I followed all of this up with an inverted Glug that raised a very quick, brief two fingers of pinkish off-white head with low retention, quickly reverting to wisps. Color was a slightly-hazy pinkish Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5 or N/A). Nose smelled like the spray of salt in heavy seas that I fell in love with in the Navy! There was an underlying tartness, but it was salty! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, actually big for the style. The taste was lightly tart, very much of watermelon, but without the usual cloying sweetness. I do not know what a prickly pear should taste like, but this was tasty! It was not hardcore tart and the flavors worked well together to make for a pleasant, easy-drinking beer. That said, 6.0% is on the high side for the style, so you should bear that in mind as a quaff CANsideration. Finish was semi-dry, but on the edge of semi-sweet!

This is a strong gose-style ale with pineapple, guava and grapefruit.\n\nPours a hazy deep yellow/golden color with a thin head of white foam that bubbles away to essentially nothing. However, incredibly tenacious carbonation activity flourishes below the surface, with tons of tiny pinprick-size bubbles rising to the top of my glass, crowding the rim.

Pretty cool looking stuff, though I definitely wish it had slightly more head retention.\n\nThe nose reminds me of Fla-vor-Ice-brand freezer pops I used to have when I was a kid. No joke, it literally smells exactly like those... talk about nostalgia! I get a lot of strangely-artificial blue raspberry here, for instance, which is really unusual. I can definitely see the pineapple addition, but the guava is a little muted. The grapefruit kind of stands out to me because it\'s so different from the other two fruits... it lends its tangy citrus note with aplomb. I think there\'s some coriander or something going on here, too, as it doesn\'t just smell like the fruit adjuncts or the typical ""tangy lemon"" element that fruited goses have. Interesting.\n\nSweet pineapple, mango and guava on the palate with a lot of intense, lingering pithiness. Grapefruit rind and salty minerality somehow gel really well here, lending an awesome bit of drinkability. This is super fruity and unique, with a well-done fruit treatment that nevertheless feels a little bit grater than the sum of its parts. Oh, and I\'m really surprised that it\'s almost 7% ABV. There\'s a slight thickness to the body here, but the crisp carbonation keeps things rather grounded for most of the time I\'m sipping at it.

A 'grapefruit gose'.\n\nThis beer pours a hazy, pale golden yellow colour, with a teeming tower of puffy, rather loosely foamy, and fizzy off-white head, which leaves a bit of scattered soap scum lace around the glass as it quickly dissipates.\n\nIt smells of soured, grainy, and crackery cereal malt, a bit of sugary lacto, ephemeral generic citrus rind, and very, very tame earthy, musty, and floral hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy pale malt, saltine crackers, soured milk (like the stuff I dumped out earlier today that expired in June), still hard to discern citric acid notes, and more well-understated earthy, leafy, and dead floral hoppiness.\n\nThe carbonation is pretty meek in its bored-seeming frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and generally smooth, as nothing really misbehaves to the point of causing concern here. It finishes off-dry, the malt and ghostly fruitiness keeping the home fires burning.\n\nOverall - yeah, I think that they must have been a tad hungover from the aforementioned excuse to drink, I mean rodeo, and forgot to actually add any grapefruit to this offering. Because if the label didn't say so, I probably would not have even noticed.

A 6.7% gose? Seems a little high, but who am I to judge?\n\nPours a foggy medium gold, with half a finger of loose, soapy white foam rising to the top before falling apart within 90 seconds or so. A thin collar sticks around, as do a few scant swaths of lace; the surface is otherwise barren, save for a few patches of bubbly film. The nose is very subtle considering the beer's ingredients - there's faint suggestions of brine, woody bark and berries, as well as some earthy, patchouli-like notes, all of which are overlain by notes of wheaty bread and yeasty spice. Hints of smoke and acidity open up slightly as the glass warms (emphasis on 'slightly').\n\nInteresting. There's a sturdy wheat malt backbone, imparting notes of doughy bread that help keep the profile centered in the midst of various much stranger flavours. The smoked myrrh is a common thread throughout the sip, as is the sea saltiness, though neither one is necessarily an overpowering feature - each outlasts the lingonberry fruitiness that comes through by mid-sip, carrying over into a spicy, rather herbal, woodsy back end. Smoked resin, salty brine and Belgian yeast spiciness characterize the finish and linger briefly into the aftertaste, along with a touch of boozy sweetness. Medium-full in body, with moderately low carbonation levels that provide a gentle bite to the mouthfeel, which is otherwise kind of frothy, thick and soft. Very little sourness; an issue I have noted in every single Beau's gose that I have tried. I'm starting to think it's deliberate.\n\nFinal Grade: 3.64, a B grade. I know that goses don't need to be puckeringly acidic, but without at least some semblance of sourness present, I didn't even feel like I was drinking a gose as I sipped my glass of 49° 54°. Rather, it felt more like some sort of smoked spiced/herbed beer with salt in it. That's not a dealbreaker or anything - and for what it's worth, I more or less enjoyed my glass - but I'd still have a hard time recommending this to anyone seeking out an honest-to-goodness gose. Still, it was unique enough to be worth a shot, and probably the best of the three Beau's goses I've tried.\xa02,226 charactersthehyperduck, Nov 27, 2018""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/15435/362440/

No lacing.\n\nBody colour is a pinkish peach of average vibrance. No yeast or lees are visible within. Translucent and semitransparent.\n\nAROMA: Pleasant smacky Lactobacillus bacteria immediately announces itself. Salty without being meaty or briney. Bright Fruity character is lovely, but I wouldn't recognize it as dragonfruit in a blind tasting. Sourness seems moderate (~4/10 in terms of intensity).\n\nThe coriander suggested on PSBC's description never emerges.\n\nSuggests a great gose with a superb balance of sour, salt, and fruit, even if the depth of flavour doesn't seem to be as on point as the finest expressions of the style.\n\nAromatic intensity is mild (apt for the style).\n\nTASTE & TEXTURE: Lovely. The dragonfruit does come through, lending this superb gose a unique memorable flavour. They committed to the salt, but it only aids the refreshing vibe of the brew. Coriander? No, but who cares? \n\nNeutral wheat glues this together, giving it a light bodied backbone that bends whimsically to the Lactobacillus bacteria pulling the strings in this build. Sourness isn't puckering, but it's apt for the style, coming in at about a 5/10 in terms of intensity. A nice lactic smackiness accompanies the bacteria.\n\nBalanced, well-built, approachable. Smooth, wet, well-carbonated. There's a natural harmony of acidic texture to twangy sour taste here.\n\nOVERALL: In short, it's well-executed across the board, though there's ample room for more depth and expressiveness of flavour; dragonfruit in this gose is not as evocative as, say, blood orange is in Anderson Valley's.\n\nHighly drinkable. Would make a superb summer brew.\n\nThe dragonfruit sets this apart from the other gosebiere in this recent craft beer trend, and I have to say I prefer this to many American expressions of the style. Hat tip to PSBC for a job well done, but let's bring that price down to local norms, eh?\n\nB (3.58) / GOOD\xa02,161 characterskojevergas, Jul 14, 2016""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/40957/239618/

Instead, a clean and acidic flavor of crabapple, gooseberry, white grape, lime and lemon transforms the watermelon into a sour and pickled rind episode. Without much sweetness, the light sourdough maltiness fuses with a rounded salinity to amplify the overall character of watermelon in the absence of much sweetness.\n\nLight bodied and insistent upon holding onto a mild bready creaminess, the beer's overall character is that of an expressively carbonated watermelon cider or wine, much like a fine sangria or simple cocktail.

Blueberry aromas abound along with the tangy underling scent of citrus, cider, wine and an overall wine cooler character. Moderately sweet and wheaten, the bready taste of pastry crust comes with aspects of saltwater taffy and nectar.\n\nThe sweetness slowly relaxes and the sourness pulls slightly ahead for a moderately sour tone that brings a brightness to the robust blackberry flavors. Lemon, apple, white grape and under ripened berries all complete the bulk of flavors while the roundness of sea salt brings a gentle brine to the late palate.\n\nLow in bitter, the medium bodied beer carries a not-so dry an not-so sweet taste through a somewhat watery texture that extends on the palate with a sensation of flat wine spritzers and kool-aid.

Yes, I know, goses are brewed with salt, but there\'s a subtlety involved. This literally tasted like it was made from unfiltered brine dredged from the Great Salt Lake. And let\'s talk about the smell. As soon as I took a whiff, I actually thought I was going to vomit. It was so nauseatingly sulfurous and swampy. I looked at the 16 ounce glass in front of me and was filled with dread and regret. But you know what, I held my breath and started gulping it down. And I actually did hold my breath, it was that hard to drink. And I know there must have actually been something wrong with the beer, because actually after about 5 or 10 minutes, I reopened my nostrils and surprisingly, the foul aroma had flashed off and the beer was somewhat palatable. Either that or my sense of smell and taste were permanently damaged. Whatever the case, I finished the whole grody glass and went on my merry way.

There’s some spiced coconut cream too, and a nice creamy vanilla finish.\n\nThis is light bodied, clean and creamy, with an awesome drinkability.

As I crack this I can hear him going ""this isn\'t a beer!"" \n\nA - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy very pale golden hue with a thin half finger white head that faded to leave a thin halo and light wisps.\n\nS - Big aromas of sweet over ripe pineapple. Tons and tons of pineapple, both fresh and canned, the coconut is a bit on the heavy toast. Decent vanilla on the aroma, not much in the way for cinnamon, good lactose, flashes of creamy wheat. Not getting much pistachio either. If this was billed as simply a \'pineapple coconut vanilla gose\' then it would be aces, however, all the other added bits don\'t quite translate on the nose.\n\nT - Taste is nice gose acidity, sour lactic notes, pie crust flavours that are stereotypical of a Westbrook gose. Big creamy wheat followed by sweeter pineapple. The pineapple is nice, not overly there bit bringing the sweet fruit. The coconut oddly enough is much more subdued than it was on the nose. The coconut that is there is almost aggressively toasty. Faint, faint vanilla and just a little bit of cinnamon. I\'m not sure if I get pistachio either. As it warms the pineapple pops even more.\n\nM - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, decent body, not as flemmy as the style can be.\n\nO - Overall this was a solid beer, however, some components next quite popped namely the cinnamon and pistachio and the coconut stayed as an overly toasted background element. The pineapple here was absolutely splendid, reminding me very much of a pineapple cider in the level of fruitiness. For that element I would drink this again but on the whole I\'d say this was one of Westbrook\'s weaker Gose entries.\n\nServing Type: Can\xa01,856 charactersrudzud, Nov 01, 2019']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24134/444272/

A moderately sweet taste leads with the simplicity of taffy, cobbler and sweet cream as the sour ale gets off to a sweeter start.\n\nBut the bracing acidity waltzed onto the middle palate and chases away much of the sweetness. The sourness that it brings highlights the dark fruit, especially the blackberry flavors for a mix of sour berry cobbler and a lime laced smoothie. Lemon, gooseberry, crabapple, wine and cider all complement the mix while other nuances of black cherry, blackcurrant, blueberry and raspberry flavors aren't far off.\n\nMedium bodied to start, the sourness creates a sharp, spicy and drying palate for a crisp, clean and highly refreshing session; one that's highly sangria-like but with a vanilla and cream type of body.

Not sure if this is a unique offering, but it's been made clear that it's not up to me.\n\nThis beer appears a murky, medium magenta colour, with a thin cap of wispy and faintly bubbly pink head, which leaves a low-lying berm of fuzzy lace around the glass as it quickly blows off. \n\nIt smells of lemon juice, mixed black berry fruity notes, white saltine crackers, gritty and grainy pale malt, a soft earthy yeastiness, and some faint leafy, herbal, and floral noble bitters. The taste is grainy and crackery cereal malt, a muddled dark stone and berry fruitiness, lemon peel, saline solution, and more understated earthy, musty, and floral green hoppiness. \n\nThe carbonation is quite meek in its perfunctory frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and mostly smooth, but for a mild fruity tartness messing with the ideal here. It finishes trending dry, the sourness amping up its lingering game. \n\nOverall - well, this is indeed a pleasantly rendered version of the style, with the unspecified 'dark fruit' carrying itself with a certain aplomb.

To this end, and since it also had a wheat malt base, I did a little bit of in-CAN agitation before Crack!ing open the vent just to ensure that everything was in suspension. The Crack! was spectacular & so I CANtinued with a slow, gentle C-Line Glug into the awaiting glass. It responded by foaming up beautifully to form two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, pinkish head that would best be described as resembling freshly-spun cotton CANdy!

And when you have the brewing prowess of Narrow Gauge the Gose style just got an upgrade.\n\nPouring a foggy and peachy mauve, the Raspberry Meersalz builds a softly pink stained froth. A juicy and tart scent of red berries decorate the nose along with notions of lemonade, rose wine and a gentle drift of citrus, burlap and sea air. But then the sweetness releases firm impressions of saltwater taffy, pastry tartlet and sourdough early in taste.\n\nAs the sour and wheaten ale splashes the middle palate, the radiant juiciness of raspberries share hard candy proportions with a achingly succulent jammy sweetness. But then the bracing sourness comes back with a crabapple, lime, lemon, gooseberry, white grape sourness. The rounded salinity and perfumy spice of coriander brings the sourness of ale and the copious raspberry flavors together seamlessly.\n\nMedium bodied for a sour ale, the off-dry flavors carry a tremendous sense of culinary art as balance to the brazen acidity that threaten to batter the palate.

A wall of drippy lacing coated the glass from top to bottom.\n\nBerry smoothie notes dominated the aroma. Freshly pureed berries, to be exact. Blackberry came through strongest. Lots of raspberry too. Perhaps some blueberry as well. Tart and slightly sweet. By the drink’s end, the maple notes finally came forth.\n\nThe flavor profile was also fantastic. Again, berry notes dominated. Blackberry was most apparent. Some raspberry was noticeable as well. Nice balance of sweet and tart. Subtle creamy vanilla notes appeared in the center. This was perhaps the milk sugar. Some lemony tartness also came through here. Crisp and slightly acidic. The beer finished tart and tangy with a hint of lingering salinity.\n\nNice creamy mouthfeel. Slick and smooth on the palate. Fuller bodied perhaps for the style. The liquid contained a super fine, mild effervesce that suited the beer perfectly.\n\nWith so many adjuncts, I was afraid this beer might come across as an overly sweet, disjointed mess, but that definitely was not the case.

Then the spicy heat comes up from swallow to the back palate. It's at a level slightly spicier than chicken paprikash, with maybe some spicy okra--mild, but good. It totally nails the homemade spicy pickle character. The fact that the base doesn't have a lot of dill to it kind of makes it work better.

Dubbed a 'Frosty Gose'.\n\nThis beer pours a murky, medium orangish-amber colour, with three flabby finger of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat creamy off-white head, which leaves some random blotchy lace around the glass as it eventually subsides.\n\nIt smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt, a lesser spicy wheatiness, seawater, some muddled citrus and dark fruity notes, and faint earthy, musty, and dead floral hop bitters. The taste is grainy and crackery pale malt, wet salted Wheat Thins, a still mixed and matched citrus and berry fruitiness, and a hint of mildly phenolic yeast.\n\nThe carbonation is average in its palate-coddling frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, and mostly smooth, with nothing really existing here that might be cause for concern. It finishes off-dry, the malt and generic frooty essences presiding.\n\nOverall - yeah, the guest ingredients pretty much just phone it in, resulting in a rather bland and uninspiring offering.

Making a little room for the aromatic particles to congregate, I dip my nose into the thimble and catch slight smells of wheat, and a lemon citrus, combined to create the sensation of something like a shandy. The flavor is mellow and savory at the same time, with a bit of plum in the aftertaste. And as the bubbles displayed earlier, the palate isn't too thin like the other Breakwater brews I've had today. Instead, the delicate but lively carbonation matches very well with the tastes and the shade of salt added into the brew.

Leading with a tangy, tropical and exotic perfume, its guava influence is a tad stronger than its winey, citrusy, wheaty perfume underneath. Light on sweetness, the taste of saltwater taffy, sourdough and honeysuckle decorate the early palate.\n\nAnd as the thirst quenching ale washes the middle palate with acidity, a lime, lemon, passionfruit, gooseberry, white grape and kiwi medley leap right out.

A very, very light ruby. Or well...cherry juicy color. The head though...two fat fingers of creamy pinkish white that leaves light side lacing and a very thick blanket. Absolutely stellar appearance for a Gose. Just stellar.\n\nS - Aromas of tart sour cherries. Almost cherry pie filling like. Not the sweet stuff from the can but very bright and just lightly jammy. The cherries overpower the base beer pretty heavily. The lemon notes of the gose are gone, replaced completely by cherries. I don\'t really get much salt at all either. The doughy grains though are still there, although much more muted now due to the addition of cherry juice. That being said, this nose is absolutely incredible. What grain element is there, combined with the massive cherry aroma, tricks the brain into smelling a fresh baked cherry pie. It\'s really, really something. I can hear JLindros in my head saying though ""where is the beer?! This doesn\'t smell like a beer"" and I guess that\'s why I wouldn\'t give it a 5. That being said I would rather have this aroma, cherry forward, than one where the cherries are muted and play second fiddle. \n\nT - Taste is similar to the nose. More of that big tart cherry pie filling going on. Really get juicy, what I imagine are montmorency, cherry flavour. Once the cherry tartness fades though there is big gose notes. The base beer really comes out, nice creamy lactic funk. Very nice cereal grains and doughy notes.

But that classic style of beer never saw this coming... Strawberry. Along with the common spice of coriander and sea salt, this garden variety fruit adds a flavor to the beer that's anything but garden variety.\n\nPinkish gold and carrying a typical wheaten haze, Strawberry Gose teases the nose with a dip into its light ivory froth with a tease of citrus, a taunt of spice and an invigorating sour scent with red berries creating whimsy and charm. Light sweetness greets the tongue with notions of pulled candy, saltwater taffy and a kiss of pastry.\n\nSweetness and breadiness drifts away effortlessly as the middle palate is a full transition over to sourness. Brisk, lemony, lime-like, with green apple, white grape and gooseberries showering the tastebuds with acidity, the ale slowly lures in the strawberry character for a taste that hinges on cranberry and rhubarb as well. A rounded salinity brings a sea-like brine to the late palate while the bright and tangy prefume of citronella offers one last jolt of complexity.\n\nMedium bodied for sour ale, the wheat isn't all lost. It makes a return on the after palate while the brunt of sourness drives home a highly refreshing, thirst quenching and effortless taste on the finish. Hints of burlap come in late and remind the senses of the beer's probiotic roots.

The taste is semi-sweet, grainy and crackery pale malt, a lesser spicy wheatiness, juicy passionfruit, fancy salt, faded yeasty notes, and more super understated earthy, herbal, and grassy green hoppiness.\n\nThe carbonation is fairly restrained in its innocuous-seeming frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, and mostly smooth, with a small airy creaminess arising as things warm up a tad around here. It finishes off-dry, the frooty character predominating.\n\nOverall - well, Matt and the gang brought the goods with this one. Definitely more sweet than tart, but, in the end, balanced.

Not overly lactic/salty. Very flavorful for the ABV. Very well balanced vibrant Japanese citrus, Lacto complexity, spice, and salt; with a nice pale/wheat malt backbone against acidity for the ABV. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness.

The Sour Note team employs the power of passionfruit to seduce its imbibers with unapologetic effect.\n\nPouring a slight foggy goldenrod, Passion Fruit Gose brings a spritzy liveliness that rises and falls with a quick, loose froth. Racy aromatics fill the nose with tropical fruit, citrus, cider and white wine along with a light leathery must. Gentle sweetness layers on the tongue with a wafer thin maltiness that's suggestive of sourdough, saltwater taffy and hard candy.\n\nSweetness fades nearly as quick as its froth while the sourness begins to build upon the middle palate. Passionfruit flavors float above the natural fruitiness of lime, lemon, white grape, green apple, gooseberry and kiwi. Melon-lie flavors come along a juicy but acidic path with distinct sour, dry, juicy kiwi taste to round out the late palate.\n\nThe softness of perfumy coriander and the rounded flavor from sea salt keeps the ale tasting and feeling full yet bright while the unique acidity of peach bring a slight stone fruit character to the finish.

Of course, when I checked out, I had to grab one, along with a four pack of yet another new Merrimack beer I\'ve not yet had or even heard of. Talk about a solid place to grab a bite to eat! Just finished the other half of my lunch and cracked open this one, so let\'s get into it!\n\nPours an almost ""cranberry juice""-like color with a quickly-fading head that leaves behind no lace whatsoever. That said, this is a quick sour so I pretty much expect very little due to the presence of lacto, which usually negatively affects head formation and retention. Great, deep color, however... some slight particulate matter floats throughout the beer but it mostly bears a consistent haze.\n\nNose is blueberry, blackberry, raspberry and the distinct tangy lemon peel note of a lacto-influenced, modernized gose-style ale. I almost get some yeasty funk, too, but it doesn\'t seem much like Brett so I don\'t think this has an issue in that regard. It\'s probably just the way the berries, citrus and base beer interact or something. Loving how rich and present the berry element is here, even with such a small beer. Just really solid.\n\nFlavor is even more on-the-mark, with stemmy blueberry, jammy raspberry and tart cranberry-like notes all vying for attention as the bright lemon peel and semi-chewy wheat beer base steer the palate quite handily. Quick burst of sourness during the transition to the middle of the tongue. Dry and yeasty finish; lightly sweet with more black raspberry-like jam as each sip closes. Super refreshing, perfect body and very drinkable. A very successful fruited gose ale and, I believe, the first canned quick-sour from these talented up-and-coming brewers. I find Merrimack pretty underrated and I hope to be able to find more cans of this so I can stock up for the dog days ahead.

The head is a light tobacco stained tan. Good head retention and lacing.\n\nAroma: There is a bit of charcoal wood and sour cherry aroma to the beer. It has a touch of bakers chocolate that only shows up every now and then, but is mostly present on the first scent. It has a bit of a cordial cherry aroma.\n\nTaste: There is a tartness to the beer which strikes the palate right at the same time that a bitter carbon flavor hits it as well. The flavors don\'t quite go together and that tartness morphs into a sour milk flavor. The aftertaste is really impressive though; it has this distinct chocolate cocoa flavor which tastes like a real piece of chocolate, and the sourness is cleaned right off the palate. There is also a bit of a lemon flavor that lingers on the palate long after the chocolate is gone.\n\nMouthfeel: The body feels light for the flavor profile. Carbonation is good. It is a clean beer and easy to drink.\n\nOverall: This beer is a bit of an oddball because it clearly tastes like a Gose but it is also a very dark beer and it tastes like chocolate. From the label, this is made from ""Dark wheat malt, chocolate malt, experimental hops, and orange rind."" There didn\'t seem to be any orange flavor to the beer but they really seemed to nail it with the chocolate malt, as it delivers a lot of chocolate flavor. This beer feels very experimental and crazy, so I would recommend it to people who want something a little strange and aren\'t afraid to step out of their comfort zones. To traditional Gose enthusiasts or orange lovers, I would say it might be worth a try but don\'t expect a ton of character.

Apparently there is a plumbing issue and as such they cannot actually serve people in the taproom, however, Dave can still brew beer there. Weird; bathrooms finally kick? And occasionally release cans it seems. 5 cases released of this, or presumably 120 cans.\n\nA - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice just barely chill hazed gold with a thin one finger white head that faded very quickly to leave no lacing and thin wisps.\n\nS - Aromas of slightly sweet watermelon juice. More of a watermelon hard candy or gummy candy than anything. I don't get any salinity on the nose, nor do I get any lemon or spice notes. Heavy swirls just intensifies the watermelon notes. The watermelon is very enjoyable but I don't really get any gose characteristics at all. Blindfolded this smells more like a 'fruit beer' ala 21st Amendment or the type of beer you might get that comes with a watermelon slice on the rim.\n\nT - Taste is more of that sweeter watermelon juice and watermelon candies. There's the gose. Big lactic tartness, wheat like flavour. There's actually some real nice salinity going on as well especially on the finish. Just lingers; if this flavour was plum instead of watermelon I'd say this 100% tasted like Umeboshi. I don't get any herbal notes, no coriander and such which is typical for the style.\n\nM - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, body is light, however the finish is very flemmy. I have to swallow a few times afterwards to try and clean out my throat after finishing a sip.\n\nO - Overall this was still surprisingly well. There are plenty of stylistic flaws; quite clear, the flem educing mouthfeel from the acidity was a bit rough, and there really wasn't any herbal notes at all. What elements are good though are quite good. I absolutely love the level of watermelon here which is a difficult flavour to translate in a beer. The salinity is spot on which is something that brewers tend to go light on. This just lacks what makes a gose a gose as this drinks more like a salty, lactic, watermelon beer and while that's not a bad thing, certainly quite enjoyable in the summer, it's hard to go much higher on this beer due to the style flaws. If you could take the base gose that say Westbrook does and give that this level of watermelon it would be just insanely good.\n\nServing Type: Can\xa02,343 charactersrudzud, Jul 28, 2019""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/37016/428860/

So when the Braxton Labs experimental team turn to the red berry, they have their work cut out for them.\n\nWith a sharp tingle to the nose, the red berry, cider, wine and fruit character screams sour fruit. Upon the pour, Cranberry Gose carries a deep blush hue with a spritzy, fast popping froth that looks exactly like sparkling rosé wine. Supple sweetness bounces off the tongue with a hint of hard candy, faint wafer and and a hint of dough. \n\nAnything that resembles sweetness dissolves quickly off the tongue. All things red berry rushes in and floods the middle palate with notions of redcurrant, cranberry, strawberry, raspberry and cherry. Once the sweetness is stripped from the fruit, the red berry character is nearly indiscernible. Still, a thought of cranberry rises above the rest, skirting just above the underlying fermentation flavors of green apple, white grape, lime and gooseberry that carry into a light finish of berries and salinity.\n\nThe moderate tannic bite of cranberry seeds even carry over to the finish with a nearly peppery spice in the absence of any hop flavor, that along with the brisk acidity creates a crisp, clean and refreshing taste.

The aroma displays some sweetish malt, some mineralish character, and just a suggestion of lime. It\'s pretty inviting whereas sometimes gosebiers can have a kind of odd note to them. On to the flavor... whoah! that\'s tart. No, I\'d call it sour. And it\'s pretty salty too, I was expecting it to be a little lighter but it\'s really full-throttle. There\'s some lime to it, just a little, and it seems completely natural. Obviously there\'s no bitterness with such acidity, and it finishes quite dry. In the mouth it\'s medium-light in body, and it\'s oddly not that carbonated. I thought there\'d be some to it, although I understand why you\'d want to tone it down with such an acidic bite to it. Maybe that\'s why there was no head, well, that and the fact that it\'s a sour beer. So, OK, where do I stand? I appreciate that they went all out with it rather than just making a kind of watered-down version, and I like the level of lime but I do wish it had a little more carbonation to it, it almost seems flat to me, and that doesn\'t help it. Still, cold on a hot day I wouldn\'t turn this down. Worth trying for fans of the style.

A succulent and souring scent of tropical fruit tease the nose along with strong impressions of lemonade, white wine and the same gentle drift of citrus, burlap and sea air of other Meersalz varieties. But then the sweetness build impressions of saltwater taffy, pastry tartlet and sourdough on the early palate.\n\nAs the sour and wheaten ale splashes the middle palate, the radiant juiciness of passionfruit share hard candy proportions with a succulent sun-kissed sweetness.

The rounded salinity and perfumy spice of coriander brings the sourness of ale and the copious passionfruit flavors together effortlessly for the late palate.\n\nMedium light bodied for a sour ale, the near dry flavors carry a tremendous sense of culinary art as an offset to the brazen acidity that threaten to dominate the taste.

The roundness of salinity gives the ale a salty taste of margarita to offset a brisk aftertaste of damp burlap and cork.\n\nMedium bodied for sour ale, the richness of salt and graham cracker eventually releases and the ale finishes crisp, clean and highly refreshing.

And at the Westbrook brewhouse, this means gose: the Northern German sour ale with corriander and salt with the complementary flavors of chocolate cream pie for a yin-and-yang of emotions as well as taste.\n\nPale gold and draped in a fine mesh haze, Chocolate Cream Pie shows no chocolaty tone in sight but once its soapy froth settles the nose picks up on the gentle savory sweetness of chocolate, vanilla and cream over a tangy backdrop of citrus, cider and sourdough. Taffy sweet maltiness greets the tongue with a lightly plump taste with a soft breadiness in tow.\n\nIts sweetness drifts away as the ale launches onto the middle palate where the citrusy tones reveal the taste of lime, lemon, green apple, gooseberry, guava and white grape. Just like in scent, the subtlety of chocolate is simple and understated while adding a fullness in taste that's backed by the sweetness of cream, vanilla and coconut for a beer that's as well suited for the dessert menu as it is the beer menu.\n\nMedium light in body, the gently spiced Gose ale trends dry, crisp and refreshing despite its decadent tilt toward the savory. In a short and citrusy finish, a hint of chocolate lingers briefly on the after palate. I've never experienced something chocolatey also being refreshing. I learned something today.\xa01,393 charactersBEERchitect, Aug 20, 2019"", ""4.04/5\xa0\xa0rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4L: Had this on-tap at Westbrook's tasting room, poured into a taster.

The taste is grainy and bready pale malt, sour apples, indistinct citrus peel, wan coriander and salt spice, some mild lacto, and more understated leafy, herbal, and musky floral green hoppiness.\n\nThe carbonation is fairly active in its palate-pinging frothiness, the body an adequate middleweight, and generally smooth, as the tartness here isn't all that threatening. It finishes off-dry, the grain, citrus, and faded spice arranging themselves as such.\n\nOverall - this comes across as a well-made example of the style, nice and crisp and refreshing. And with the very session-friendly ABV, one could put back a sixer of these no problem over the course of an afternoon whilst grilling up something meaty on the ol' BBQ, methinks.\xa01,212 charactersbiboergosum, May 15, 2018""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/29299/344975/

From the burnt orange body to the flowery and woody feel, gose is not the style I would have ever guessed if blind tasted. The gose yeast and slight pucker is there... somewhere in the finish. Otherwise the coolship treatment has provided a ton of wood, citrus zest, a lightheartedness to the sour and acid.

The last white wine I made had dried elderflowers in it, curious to see how it works here.\n\nThis beer pours a slightly hazy, pale golden straw colour, with four fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat creamy bone-white head, which leaves a bit of low-lying streaky lace around the glass as it quickly blows off.\n\nIt smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt, a strong musky floral character, muddled domestic citrus rind, some coriander and black pepper spiciness, and faint estery yeasty notes. The taste is grainy and crackery pale malt, more dirty florals, still indistinct generic citrus peel, semi-sweet coriander, and some ethereal herbal, musty, and dead grassy hoppiness.\n\nThe carbonation is average in its palate-satiating frothiness, the body a decent medium weight, and mostly smooth, with just a touch of floral acridity maybe not making nice with the neighbourhood kids at this particular juncture. It finishes off-dry, the malt and elderflower locked in a lingering pas-de-deux.\n\nOverall - this is a pleasantly rendered version of the style, with the guest flower ingredient doing well enough to not overstep its bounds.

Not quite perfectly clear, but good enough that I can see my fingers through the glass. Above once held a thin lightly tanned foam, but as expected with the style, it vacated immediately and never leaves even a suggestion that it ever existed.\n\nOn the note of pomegranate, this has a sour dark fruitiness to the aroma.

First up - my experience with Gose’s are limited but ever expanding. I’ve found they generally taste a bit like Eno - that delightful salty/lemon antacid drink. Yep, Gose’s and Eno are strange bedfellows, but Eno is refreshing ergo Gose’s are too. This one has passionfruit too, so it should be a nice salty tropical summery brew then. Plus at 4.2% ABV it means you can drink even more at the BBQ your GF dragged you along to and still drive... eventually... yay! This can suggests 7 Bells is a part of Green Beacons ever-expanding core range (it’s not a printed label and is brightly coloured like their core range cans) however I reckon it’s a seasonal ;) \n\nPoured from a 375ml can into a Duvel tulip.\n\nA: CLAAAASIC Gose look: cloudy pale straw body with an excitable white sea foam head that thins down to a snowy blanket on top. Well, well, Green Beacon have nailed that Gose look... then the head completely died. Still looks good. 8/10.\n\nS: Passionfruit upfront, but it’s got a weird tropical Berocca (fizzy good, make feel nice tablets) character. Then it’s got yeast, not quite as bad as Edge Pomegranate Sour, but it’s a noticeable dusty tome (LOL!). Hints of sea salt, but interestingly no lemon - nearly every Gose I’ve tried has had lemon in the flavour profile. Hmmm, a bit too musty but not bad GB. 6/10.\n\nT: Huh, passionfruit Eno... interesting... not as refreshing IMO as the original lemon Eno (sorry GB). Yeast is a bit on the prominent side, dusting its way throughout the flavour profile, salt also comes in a bit sharp, finishes slightly tart and mildly bitter. Other than that it’s a bit on the plain side. Ticks the Gose boxes though. 6/10.\n\nM: Mid to light bodied with a light but spritzy carbonation and a lively tongue-feel (yeah that’s right - I said “tongue-feel”, I’m mixing that shit up yo). 7/10.\n\nD: It’s definitely not the train-wreck that Pomegranate Sour was, but it’s probably the least refreshing beer I’ve had from Green Beacon, though pretty much all their beers hit “the spot” so it’s not a Greek tragedy that 7 Bells is a bit “meh”. TBH I’m not sure Green Beacon even needed to invent this new beer - not when they’ve got solid corkers like Uppercut IIPA, Whaler Blood Orange IPA, and Scrimshaw IPA sitting in the wings as limited release beers - FFS Green Beacon, pick any of those 3 beers to brew year-round and I will be able to die a happy man!!! Not that we’re not already spoiled for choice these days [shud-up me!]. 6/10.\n\nFood match: Seafood for sure: Oysters with lemon juice, and Kilpatrick (no really).\xa02,719 charactersdoktorhops, Jan 25, 2018']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32047/323760/

Built upon a light pastry sweetness, the taste of sweetened pie crust joins the flavor fray. \n\nAnd as the scant sweetness fades further and further into the recesses of taste, the beer's sourness wins out, carrying first the taste of tangy red berry, bing cherry, rose wine, citrus and cider. All trending more dry than sweet, the taste soon transfers to a sharply acidic taste of lactic sourness with a brisk afterpalate of the sea to follow.\n\nMedium bodied for sour but rather suitable for gose, the beer's wheaten aftertaste is joined by the pillowy softness of starch, protien and a creamy substrate of carbonation. Moderate sourness leads to a moderate dryness and a light saltine roundness and a bright orange perfume that plays out underneath the fruit additions.

I also employed a more heavy-handed C-Line Glug than usual, resulting in a pseudo-cascade. This took a little while to settle into two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, pinkish head that looked like freshly-spun cotton CANdy. I was really impressed by its head retention since such rarely happens in/with this style. Color was a murky, turbid Magenta (SRM = N/A). Nose smelled redolently of raspberries & salt! 8=O Mouthfeel was medium, big for the style. The taste was quite tart, driven by the raspberries, but backed up by the salt & coriander. I didn\'t really perceive that plums & apricots, but there was a LOT going on with this one, to the point that it was tough to parse one flavor from another. This put me in mind of a salted fruit smoothie, which is not a bad thing. The fruit was an inspired addition in this case & I am a big fan of saltiness, so what was not to like? Yum. Finish was quite dry, lightly puckering & nicely tart. It hid its 8.0% ABV well, making it a little too drinkable for comfort. This was CANother impressive beer from this CANadian brewery!

Head settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass. Not much lacing though. Aromas of some crisp wheat and bready malts that give way to some hints of barnyard funk and notes of plum. The taste is pretty much the same, with some crisp wheat and bready malts with mild sweetness followed by some barnyard funk and a hint of grape sourness as well as just a hint of salt and vinegar. Rounded out with a bit of sweetness from the plums. Not really any discernible hop presence here.

A salt crust forms around the mouth while drinking, and it becomes very salty over time.\n\nMouthfeel: It is smooth but a sharp tartness cuts at the tongue. It is medium bodied and finishes dry on the palate.\n\nOverall: The can states that this is made ""with Peaches, Lemons, Limes and Apricots conditioned on Oak."" There is a definite tartness to the beer but it doesn\'t convey any clear fruit aromas or flavors. The oak it was conditioned on doesn\'t appear to add any flavor either.

The body itself is completely opaque with a dull matte sheen.\n\nNose: Berries on berries. Sweet macerated blackberry, blueberry, currant, and raspberry. The lacto tang also gives a hint of creaminess, giving the impression of mixed berry yogurt. There\'s a faint note of salinity, as a good gose should possess. There\'s a faint impression of clean, pale grain, which shows the senses that it\'s still certainly beer, however, there is no olfactory indication of any hopping. \n\nPalate: Both a subtle sweetness, restrained tartness, and hint of salinity hit the palate simultaneously. The bouquet of berries comes into focus next, with strawberry and raspberry taking the lead. Flavours of currant, blackberry, and blueberry are also evident. The sweetness and flavour of the berries paired with the slightly salty tang really go nicely together, and all is well. However, there is a very sharp, almost acrid bitterness that comes into clear focus shortly after. It isn\'t a pithy or resinous bitterness that one would associate with hops, but rather a very tannic, almost medinal bitterness, like what you would find in the pits or seeds of certain fruit. I\'m not entirely sure if perhaps the berry seeds are responsible for this bitterness, or if it\'s due to something else, but it is quite distracting, and ultimately detrimental to the overall experience. There is also a creamy, milky flavour that tastes exactly like lactose, although the can says nothing about it, therefore I will assume there is none in the beer. This creamy aspect slightly dampens the bitterness a little, but not entirely, as it lasts well into the finish, where the creaminess fades away, along with the sweetness and salinity, leaving a fairly dry aftertaste, with the bitterness being the only thing to linger. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium-to-full-bodied, with a thick, creamy feel about it, giving it a ""milkshake-like"" quality. Effervescence is very fine, and rather scarce, to the point where it feels like it\'s lacking a little bit. The little bit of carbonation seems to be at odds with the creamy body. The beer is fairly wet upfront, becoming fairly dry in the finish. \n\nOverall: This beer feels confused. It looks great, it smells great, and it tastes great, for the first third of the experience, before the aggressive, biting bitterness comes in, and lasts well into the finish. The mouthfeel isn\'t a strong point of this beer. The thick creamy body seems out of place, and is somewhat of a turnoff. The enjoyable qualities just don\'t seem to outweigh the distracting negative qualities, and for me, personally, I have a hard time enjoying this one. There are others that will not mind the texture, and even fewer who may be able to look past the astringent bitterness, but for me, it\'s a miss - and that\'s saying nothing of the serious price tag on this one.\xa03,028 charactersSierraNevallagash, Jul 26, 2019']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/36073/430080/

Pipe dream aside Doctor’s Orders claim they brought the Gose style to Australia, and they could be right - Gose’s haven’t been around for long even though they were popularised in the states since before I got into craft beer.

I’ve had Gose’s before (6 according to my BA account), so this isn’t simply a case of being unfamiliar with the style - this brew is a bit of a mess. Other notes of the above: salt, banana, rhubarb, barnyard yeast and an overall grainy character. Admittedly the more I drank the less bad it became... my taste buds probably surrendered to its weirdness. Again: hard to love. 6/10.\n\nM: Body is alright though - mid to light, with a creamy dense carbonation (that’s the wheat for you - always bringing body). 8/10.\n\nD: Not a fan, and I’ve had Gose’s I’ve liked before. This is the unholy marriage of beer and a sports drink - please heed my words. It’s still better than a Victoria Bitter though - so really let’s give Doctor’s Orders some credit. Also Gose’s are a tricky style: it Gose with the territory [been waiting to crack out that pun for a while now, cheers!]. 5/10.\n\nFood match: This feels like something to drink after a workout session.\xa02,505 charactersdoktorhops, May 25, 2017']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/21430/283422/

Smooth mouthfeel with a light body and medium carbonation.\n\nThis just seems poorly balanced, to be honest: too sweet and malty, too salty and just not tart/acidic enough at all, almost being non-existent, actually. Its one saving grace are some nice estery fruit notes and the use of green pepper, which is interesting, but doesn't really work all that well here either, being quite floral, although it does seem to turn a bit more spicy in the aftertaste.

A finger worth of sea foam pink bubbles that leave a heavy wall as they slowly recede.\n\nThe nose carries berries and slight acidity while the flavor does the same, except adding a layer of malt base. Crisp wheat. This is light and refreshing. Not picking up much, if any salt but there is a very light, natural acidity. This would be absolutely wonderful by the pool or ocean.

Trending both sour and bitter, the togetherness of these palate sensations suggest ruby red grapefruit flavor. Tea-like with a hint of gin, the finish is gently sprucy with a medium short linger of fruit skins and seed spiciness.\n\nMedium light in body, the tart and moderately bitter beer offers a drying palate to contend with the juice sweetness while the creaminess of wheat is a buffer for the minty alcohol spice. Trying hard to become a sangria, hints of white wine shine through the Citra hops and the fruit additions for a cidery, vinous session throughout.\xa01,333 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 09, 2019']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28764/443951/

A member of the wait staff was very nice as she helped me but told me that this was an IPA and would be hoppier than the other IPA I bought. Nope. It's unique but I would describe this as a Belgian Gose, or possibly some kind of specialty sour beer. Not my type of beer. In general, I don't like sours, Belgians, or Gose. I'm an IPA, Stout & Porter guy. After considering dumping it after the first sip though, it grew on me a bit. Lightly golden with active carbonation, it pours with a small head & leaves no lacing.

Mild carbonation and no where near spritzy like that of those hailing from Leipzig. Despite this, a very easy to drink beer.\n\nAll in all, this should have been called a ""Salted IPA"".

There are a number of sour varieties now and the only option I find even remotely appropriate is a Gose and this is not a Gose. This is a soured kettle ale that poured nicely and had some beautiful and pungent fruity notes on the nose.

This version was brewed and bottled at BioNoc\' using Pediococcus (and possibly lactobacillus) and Himalayan pink salt.\n\nAppearance: Slightly hazy straw gold body beneath a bright white head. Head retention and lacing are limited, but that\'s somewhat expected for the style.\n\nAroma: Fruity and sour combined.\n\nFlavor: Salt upfront, quickly fruity, then sour. The malt comes through towards the swallow. Very nicely balanced, not too sour or salty; and with a good transition of the flavors across the palate - something that you don\'t necessarily find in gosebiers.\n\nMouthfeel: Light-medium to medium-light in body and bristling with a fine-bubbled, gently effervescent carbonation.\n\nOverall: Quite pleasant!

Really interesting. Hints of lager-type malts.\n\nTaste doesn't have quite the same enticing layers. Much more muddled and subdued. Light earthiness and more grains than tart or salinity. There is a little bit of each of the latter in there though, Focus is more on the earthy grains though, which is enjoyable enough on its own, but seems a little out of place in the style. Finish draws closer to the tart but it's not a bright tartness, much more dull/earthy but still a little tart. Might be some banana-esque in there as well, but it could be an artifact of hearing Umqombothi described using banana-descriptors, since this features sorghum, and sorghum is used in Umqombothi, and I don't really know what sorghum tastes like otherwise, ha.\n\nDrinkable and enjoyable.

With a decidedly fruity scent, the strawberry finesse rests upon a sour and citrusy base with apple, lemon and lime. Its taste is faintly sweet to start, casting hints of doughy sweetness through fresh pilsner grain and whole wheat bread.\n\nThe malts and sweetness dissolves quickly over the tongue and leaves the full brunt of taste to rest squarely upon the sourness, fruitiness and supportive earth. While strawberry character remains in charge, there\'s suggestions of raspberry, sour cherry, green apple, dry white wine and citrusy sourness that smack the tastebuds around with their sheer lactic sourness. With little in the way of coriander perfume, the finish is playfully salty yet careful not to interfere with the delicate aura of strawberry.\n\nLight in body, the beer\'s relative stillness renders is needing greater life, personality and sprite. But the acidity enlivens the taste regardless and closes the session clean, crisp and greatly refreshing. With an undercurrent of wheat dough and sour fruit, the taste lingers slightly in aftertaste.\xa01,443 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 06, 2015']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28188/198240/

Head sticks for a while but eventually disappears.\n\nTaste is balanced and smooth, and the rounded notes from the aroma now reveal themselves more clearly and identifiably after the middle stage of taste.

I am going to see ""Hustlers"" this afternoon so I wanted to get an early start. I have to cop to cheating … sorta. This one was not a part of the backlog, but knowing that today was on the horizon, I snagged it at the FGBS on Friday night with an eye to today. It still hearkens back to Week 759.\n\nFrom the CAN: ""Another matter entirely. Unique brews that run the gamut of the beer style palette from batch to batch.""\n\nI have alluded to it before, but while not being much of a Tart/Sour guy, I have a real affinity for Goses. It is the inclusion of (usually Sea) salt that really sends me as a retired sailor. Lime? Mmm. \n\nHaving Crack!ed open the vent, the room suddenly filled with the scent of salt & lime! Phew. I mouth beCAN to water as I performed a heavy-handed aggro C-Line Glug into the awaiting glass.

Color was an oh-so-slightly-hazy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5). Leaning in for a sniff, the nose was REALLY salty, held in check by the lime citrusiness. Mmm. Mouthfeel was thin & watery, but on par for the style. The taste was REALLY tart & puckering, like liquefied alum! Once the initial tartness subsided, the lime & salt REALLY asserted themselves! Phew. Tart, salty, lime citrusy, this one had it all! Of course, I was having a tough time prising my lips open, but that was a horse of a different color.

Light red and purple color, looks a little bit like a cranberry vodka, thin almost nonexistant head of about 1/10"" in a lighter shade of that purple/pink/red regime. Had that red wine barrel nose to it, earth, dark grape, dark oak nose. Not much for salinity there, still hasn\'t shown itself to me much of a traditional gose by any means. \n\nTaste was where it excelled, there was a brackish in the slightest form of a red wine meets gose vibe going on, a little bit of dark cherry and blackberry note to it. The mouth feel was very dry. Lots of oak and tannin dryness. Was a good beer, glad to have checked it out, shit I\'d even vote they package this one up.

Am I imagining this, amidst the coriander and sea salt?\n\nTartness returns again with each new sip, goes down easy. It’s not as intensely puckering as some may want, but it’s got the tart and it’s individual. Special. Approachable. And I can dig it.

Been a while, yes - I took some time out after review #900 to rest my liv-actually I was just about to lie, I’ve still been drinking beer, just needed a break from writing reviews, you think this stuff just comes natural to me? Well, anyway, here’s another Nomad Gose, this one caught my eye because - coffee in my Gose? That sounds intriguing. I bit into Nomad’s pitch hook, line, sinker. As the label states “In Napoli they add a pinch of salt to their morning espresso”... never knew that, I might have to give it a go sometime. So I’m a sucker for coffee, I love it, and when two things I love come together... well that’s why I love coffee beers so much - it’s the best of both worlds (sometimes!).\n\nPoured from a 330ml can into a Duvel tulip.\n\nA: Easily the darkest Gose I’ve encountered - with a deep black/brown body and a splotchy mocha-coloured blanket on top. The head bubbles look reasonably dense, so the mouthfeel should be decent, cool as brah. 8/10.\n\nS: Roast cold drip coffee mingles with coffee bean, and a nutty/earthy note, hint of salt as well. Some beers don’t even smell like beer to me anymore, and this is one of them - the coffee notes dominate the olfactory senses and we end up with an aroma that could only be described as “coffee soda”... that’s what it reminds me of: Those Asian cans of coffee - Mr. Brown I think it’s called. 7/10.\n\nT: Cold drip coffee front/back/all over with a granular earthy/nutty character, a touch of malt sweetness (like the teaspoon of coconut blossom sugar I add to my morning coffee) with, yep you guessed it - sea salt. The sea salt gives this brew a palate drying effect which works well. Finish finds that fine line between bitter and sweet (and salty). Surprisingly delightful brew this! 8/10.\n\nM: Mid to light - a touch watery - with a very dense (and unfortunately flat) carbonation. Here’s the weakest link of this brew: Lack of body and carbonation, it’s not a game-killer though. 6/10.\n\nD: I liked this. It was slightly sweet, slightly bitter, slightly salty, and coffee all over - if you’re adverse to those things then steer clear, if not this is a tasty brew that I can imagine having as a breakfast beer. As far as Goses go(ses) this is probably one of the best - though it’s the least to style - one that I’ve had. Hopefully Nomad will make more so I can get my coffee/beer fix heading in to summer (which is apparently now in Queensland dammit). 8/10.\n\nFood match: Not sure why but this brew made me want a cannolo...

Right? Never underestimate the brewing prowess that comes when Blue Stallion Brewing teams up with Wilderness Trail Distilling. On thing's for sure, that Leipzig styled gose never saw this coming.\n\nPicking up a lot of caramelized color from the barrel, the Rum Barrel Aged Tropical Gose pours a chestnut bush color with a fairly light haze. As a short lived froth builds on the beer, the nose leads with a gentle sweetness and spiciness of rum with a twinge of citrus and tropical succulence and sourness. And that shy caramelization shows up early on the palate with a toasty, nutty taste of cashew, candy and sourdough.\n\nAs the flavors unfold on the middle palate, the caramel gives way to the natural fruit flavors of cider, wine, lime, lemon and passionfruit. As the nutty cocktail-like taste steers from the normal taste of gose, the barrel brings a surprising flavor of candied apples with a light simmer of classic rum alcohol and peppery spice.\n\nThe sour ale picks up a slight heft as it takes on new lift which jeopardizes its refreshment and effortlessness on the palate, but its added complexity is charming as it fares much better than once believed.\xa01,237 charactersBEERchitect, Jan 15, 2019""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32180/393118/

He has raved about Lead Dog, but I think this would be my first time having one from them. I had to add this to Beer Advocate, so my guess it was a very new beer. On the can it read, “This delicious Gose is touched by a hint of sea salt which lends to a refreshing and crisp tartness that may be enjoyed by sour lovers. And even those who still have their training wheels on. We age this Gose with sweet and tart cherries to deliver a red color and slightly sweet finish.” Was looking forward to it.\n\nPoured a medium amber clear color with one finger of fizzy off-white head. Lots of fast-moving bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Average watery lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 3.50)\n\nSmelled tart cherries up front, followed immediately by sea salt. Also cranberry, coriander peel, citrus zest, cereal and grass. (Smell - 3.75)\n\nTasted a little better than the nose. Not as much a salt as I would’ve thought, which I didn’t mind. Got cherry, cranberry, coriander zest, cereal, grain, hints of cinnamon and earthy salt grass. (Taste - 3.75)\n\nLight body. Thin-to-oily texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt finish. (Feel - 4.00)\n\nStill new to the style, but this was at least very good overall. I was back and forth on a few of the categories.

Teaming with local Ethereal brewers, the popular German-style gose meets a tropical fruit addition to add complexity to the natural citrus, apple and melon character of the base beer. \n\nBright straw and with a light translucent glow, the beer shares a mild pinkish hue from the colorful dragonfruit. A zesty and sprite froth swells and quickly collapses upon itself for a still but peppy appearance. Tangy aromas of cider, white wine, citrus and tropical fruits capture an essence of hawaiian punch with the soft must of the sea. Sweet and sour on the palate, a hint of sour patch kids ride on the heels of wheat and pilsner bready sweet flavor.\n\nThe sweetness dissolves on the middle palate and the bright fruitiness takes center stage. Lime, lemon, crabapple, sour green grape, gooseberry and kiwi flavors meld seamlessly with the exotic and slight robust tropical fare of passionfruit and dragonfruit. Low on hops, its the brazen sourness of the lactic fermentation that chases a clean and acidic finish as a return of sea and brine return.\n\nGiving the light bodied beer a little more robust and bright flavor, the mild salt additions add a fullness to the beer's flavor without sacrificing cleanliness or crispness. Perfumy coriander allows for a finish of orange peel bitterness and earthy burlap after palate.\xa01,404 charactersBEERchitect, Jan 10, 2017""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32180/263360/

Yum!\n\nThis beer pours a clear, pale bronzed amber colour, with three fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat fizzy pink-tinged white head, which leaves pretty much nothing in the way of lace anywhere near the glass as it quickly dissipates.\n\nIt smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt, saltine crackers, some musty yeastiness, faint indistinct berry fruity notes, and ethereal earthy, leafy, and floral noble hop bitters. The taste is bready and grainy pale malt, saline solution, some mealy dark fruitiness, fading estery yeast, and more well-understated earthy, musty, and floral green hoppiness.\n\nThe carbonation is adequate in its palate-pinging frothiness, the body a basic medium weight, and mostly smooth, as only the mild salty essence may be a small cause for concern here. It finishes trending dry, the malt maintaining a crackery lingering stance.\n\nOverall - yeah, this is certainly more 'gose', than 'strawberry' in its bearing. It's not bad, but I was imagining that burst of insane fruity goodness that you get when eating one of those tiny strawberries you find growing on the sides of mountain hiking paths in the late summer.

This Gose is earthy with white pepper and coriander.\n\nThe flavor is dry with tart lemon, salty and fresh. It is equally light bitter and light sweet. A quick mild finish follows the nose while warmth introduces grapes.\n\nThe body is surprisingly full with a smooth soft texture. Modest fine carbonation helps elevate this very dry palate with no alcohol presence.\n\nThis is an excellent beer for relaxing and quite a surprise.

Head, about an inch, white in color.\n\nSmell: Grapefruit, its usage can really trounce things with unabashed sharp, citric bitterness. Basil, its usage can really trounce things with what seems akin to something of a juice cleanse diet. I'll admit, I was hesitant. Okay, so I grimaced reading the label. However, the aromatics are nicely blended and play well together. Underneath, a delicate tartness, a noted salinity and a touch of sour wheatiness.\n\nTaste: Sourish, lactic wheat, albeit thin on the wheat with a quick, brief, low-level sweetness. Early on, the salt content, while never overwrought, is quickly discernible. Mildly juicy, citrusy from the grapefruit and has that unmistakable herbal zip from the basil -- both without going overboard and having me trudge off to the nearest sink. The salt has both an accumulative and sort of cleansing effect, aided by a little final spritz of carbonation at the finish.\n\nMouthfeel: Medium-thin body.

I definitely get the guava fruit on the nose, along with some grapefruit pulp, lemon, and a hint of honeydew melon.\n\nLight body with a soft feel and a refreshing, fruity flavor. Up front is a brief, faint, grainy sweetness that is quickly followed up by guava, some lemon, and a bit of salinity. It almost reminds me of citrus cooler-flavored gatorade. The guava and lemon intensify as the beer moves across the palate. The finish is fruity and a little dry. Overall, the beer is easy to drink and very thirst-quenching.

And when the two brewing minds of Blue Stallion and Ethereal come together, a fantastic beer is born just in time for Lexington's Craft Beer Week 2018. A pomegranate, lime and hibiscus gose shows no lacking in creativity, complexity nor intrigue.\n\nComing with the opaque and matte finish appearance of mauve, lavender and peach, a creamy eggshell froth builds while the overwhelming fruit aromas are berry-like, citrusy, cider-like and winey. Simple sweetness, creaminess and soft spice aligns on the tongue like fruit smoothies with hints of pastry, sourdough and saltwater taffy.\n\nLike a gose on steroids, the natural apple and lime character is heightened with added actual lime flavor along with a rich pomegranate, cranberry, raspberry taste. Still tart with crabapple, lemon and sparkling white wine, the taste flirts dangerously close with wine cooler before an herbal and floral late palate of hibiscus, citronella, orange peel and faint grassiness trend tart, tangy and playfully acidic.\n\nMedium bodied but quite full for gose, the lingering fruit sweetness and bready starchiness keeps the ale creamy, textural and weighted. Soothing hints of vanilla and cream soften the tepid sourness while a medium short aftertaste of macerated berries and sangria come with brief echoes.\xa01,310 charactersBEERchitect, May 25, 2018""]",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32180/347625/

The taste is gritty and grainy pale malt, red grapefruit peel, ethereal saline solution, white sugar, and more understated leafy, herbal, and floral hoppiness.\n\nThe carbonation is average in its palate-propping frothiness, the body a decent medium weight, and generally smooth, with a nice airy creaminess arising as soon as things start to warm up a tad around here. It finishes off-dry, the malt and agave nectar exhibiting the most lingering fervour.\n\nOverall - this comes across as a well-made version of the style, deftly balanced, and quite refreshing.

The taste is grainy and crackery pale malt, some mixed dark fruitiness, saltwater, a hint of estery yeast, and more well-understated earthy, musty, and herbal hoppiness. \n\nThe carbonation is adequate in its palate-assuring frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and generally smooth, with nothing really getting in the way of a refreshing time at this particular juncture. It finishes trending dry, the malt faltering in the face of the tart lingering frooty essences. \n\nOverall - this comes across as a pleasantly rendered version of the style, with the guest ingredients doing well to add and not detract from the whole experience. Crisp, and rather easy to put back on a sunny and unseasonably warm January afternoon.\xa01,220 charactersbiboergosum, Jan 20, 2019']",Leipzig Gose,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/45840/393965/

Acquired ages ago from Trembling Madness in York. The name and label are fairly cryptic and don't give much away - it's not clear why this is called Hot Toddy. Does it contain lemon, honey or spices? We shall see....\n\nA: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Bottle conditioned. A deep, hazy marmalade-amber hue with fine suspended sediment and good carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a minute or two before reducing to a patchy surface layer.\n\nS: Aroma of tart, earthy yeast with hints of mild caramel malt, a touch of smokiness, faint lemon/citrus, vague stewed leaves and a delicate mustiness in the background. Acidic but otherwise very hard to place.\n\nT: Tastes of sour lactic acid with notes of subtle caramel malt, earthy yeast, mild lemon, a twinge of honey, faint stewed leaves and a lingering mustiness. Pretty sharp and bone dry but no bitterness to speak of.\n\nM: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with spritzy carbonation and good body. Somewhat astringent - strips the palate. Aftertaste of sourness, subtle lemon, a hint of malt and earthiness.\n\nO: Drinkable but weird. This is classed as a Gose, which I guess is correct but there's nothing on the label to indicate this. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are dominated by lactic acid sourness, lemon, faint malt and earthiness. Decent body. Generally OK; I'm just a tad confused about what the brewer was aiming for. But perhaps that's how it is when the brewery is called Mad Hatter.
