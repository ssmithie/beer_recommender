The perfect beverage for any outdoor soirée, Garden Party delivers the sparkle of champagne, the floral delicacy of elderflowers and the brilliance of sweet lemon zest—bringing refinement and refreshment to your party, wherever it may be.\"\\n\\n5 oz pour on tap. The first sip yields heavy funk and a surprising amount of sweetness - not a great combination. However, the sweetness mellows out and gives way to oak, lemon, vanilla, white grape juice, and a floral component that must be the elderflowers. A unique beer for sure and decently complex. Not my favorite, but better than it seemed at first sip.'"

      "\n",
      "Nose: A hefty base of caramel malt is apparent on the nose. Slightly sweet, slightly toasty, crisp, and warm. Among the malt, a generous dose of Cascade hops waft up, with aromas of grapefruit, lemon, pine resin, pear, and perhaps even a note of sweet ripe mango. There is no earthiness, but rather a green element to the nose that evokes images of a forest. Lots of floral notes as well, including lilac, hyacinth, and Easter lilly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palate: Like the nose, the first sip unfolds with caramel malt. Semi-sweet, slightly toasty, and crisp, with notes of caramel, fresh bread, and toffee. Hops cut in rather late, bringing mostly pine sap, spring florals, cedar, and some citrus character. There is less of a grapefruit note than one might imagine with a beer like this. Cascade hops are not like Citra. They are piney, resinous, and sort of \"woodsy\". In fact, I would say the citrus notes in this beer are far closer to lemon than grapefruit. Only upon swallowing do the hops really overtake the malt, with a gentle bitterness showing up in the finish, amd the flavour profile becoming drier and more resinous. Still, well after the finish, the aforementioned caramel malt sweetness is still detectable in small doses around the palate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium bodied, crisp in nature, but the caramel malt provides a soft, slick, slightly chewy feel to it. For a pale ale, it certainly has some respectable weight to it, and a really employable softness. Effervescence is lively and plentiful, and also incredibly fine, almost champagne-like. Still, while the beer is crisp and drinkable, and although it has a fairly low ABV, I don't think I would want to drink more than 24oz in one sitting. This is one where the weight of the malt may creep up on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a classic. It's an old school, West Coast staple. Each of us have most likely consumed gallons of this stuff by this point, and there is a very good reason for that. It is a stellar beer. It's a no-frills, simple, easy, highly polished hoppy ale that does not demand one's attention with complexity, while remaining incredibly flavour-saturated, and never boring. It is a perfect default beer that most can agree on. It's affordable, it's tasty, it's incredibly consistent, and the quality is top notch. It won't win any awards for exotic hops or complex tropical fruit notes, but it does everything you want it to do and more, and for that, it really is one of the greatest pale ales on the market.\n",

It’s hard to believe it’s a “daily beer” for the amazing quality of taste and aroma and texture. No beer can touch this one for a daily drink ale. The Sierra Nevada hoppier ales (like the Little Hazy Thing and Celebration Ale) kick it up a notch with more highlights, but are truly a more “special brew” style not a daily brew to enjoy.

Fine ascending streams of effervescence are visible.\\n\\nNose: A hefty base of caramel malt is apparent on the nose. Slightly sweet, slightly toasty, crisp, and warm. Among the malt, a generous dose of Cascade hops waft up, with aromas of grapefruit, lemon, pine resin, pear, and perhaps even a note of sweet ripe mango. There is no earthiness, but rather a green element to the nose that evokes images of a forest. Lots of floral notes as well, including lilac, hyacinth, and Easter lilly.\\n\\nPalate: Like the nose, the first sip unfolds with caramel malt. Semi-sweet, slightly toasty, and crisp, with notes of caramel, fresh bread, and toffee. Hops cut in rather late, bringing mostly pine sap, spring florals, cedar, and some citrus character. There is less of a grapefruit note than one might imagine with a beer like this. Cascade hops are not like Citra. They are piney, resinous, and sort of \"woodsy\". In fact, I would say the citrus notes in this beer are far closer to lemon than grapefruit. Only upon swallowing do the hops really overtake the malt, with a gentle bitterness showing up in the finish, amd the flavour profile becoming drier and more resinous. Still, well after the finish, the aforementioned caramel malt sweetness is still detectable in small doses around the palate.\\n\\nMouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium bodied, crisp in nature, but the caramel malt provides a soft, slick, slightly chewy feel to it. For a pale ale, it certainly has some respectable weight to it, and a really employable softness. Effervescence is lively and plentiful, and also incredibly fine, almost champagne-like. Still, while the beer is crisp and drinkable, and although it has a fairly low ABV, I don\\'t think I would want to drink more than 24oz in one sitting. This is one where the weight of the malt may creep up on you.\\n\\nOverall: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a classic. It\\'s an old school, West Coast staple. Each of us have most likely consumed gallons of this stuff by this point, and there is a very good reason for that. It is a stellar beer. It\\'s a no-frills, simple, easy, highly polished hoppy ale that does not demand one\\'s attention with complexity, while remaining incredibly flavour-saturated, and never boring. It is a perfect default beer that most can agree on. It\\'s affordable, it\\'s tasty, it\\'s incredibly consistent, and the quality is top notch. It won\\'t win any awards for exotic hops or complex tropical fruit notes, but it does everything you want it to do and more, and for that, it really is one of the greatest pale ales on the market.\\n\\n 2,872 characters\\n\\nSierraNevallagash, Jun 06, 2019  Report',\n",

Ale yeast are known to produce by-products called esters, which are \"flowery\" and \"fruity\" aromas ranging, but not limited to apple, pear, pineapple, grass, hay, plum, and prune.\n",

A perfect description as lagers are brewed with bottom fermenting yeast that work slowly at around 34 degrees F, and are often further stored at cool temperature to mature. Lager yeast produce fewer by-product characters than ale yeast which allows for other flavors to pull through, such as hops.\n",

While this beer is nothing spectacular at the end of the day, I found myself buying a couple of cases of this from a nearby HEB to drink while I was in Austin. It's such a simple product, but something about it just appeals to me. It has a pleasant mild maltiness, with decidedly a stronger flavour than your run-of-the-mill domestics. No nasty adjunct flavours, and pours an attractive light brown colour. It's a beer that you can - and I did - drink several of in one go. \\n\\nI can understand why this beer is so popular in Texas. Just a shame they haven't exported it across the border.\\xa0879 charactersOlek4374, Yesterday at 11:15 AM\",\n",

It looks like watered down Coke when poured and it has white foam on top. It has very little aroma, faint sulphur was all I got. It’s very thin with a slight burnt flavor, very tasteless. I guess it’s ok for mass production and folks used to drinking nothing but adjunct whatever. Shiner makes products that I really like but this isn’t one of them. Good marketing has made this a big hit for them though. I use it to cook brats in and that’s it.\\xa0526 charactersgvickery, Nov 15, 2019',\n",

There are some beers that hit you in the heart and defy explanation as to why I like them. Shiner Bock is one of them. It gets a 5 for me on taste for no reason other than I really like it. Is it the greatest beer I've ever tasted? No way. Is it the most beautiful looking - no to that too. St. Boniface in Ephrata has the most striking copper-y brews I've seen. Bouquets of citrus, chocolate or malt? Nope. So why Shiner Bock? I don't know.

Okay, the Shiner is dark amber but at 4.4% ABV, more of a light beer than a bock.

Rich dark malt profile gently kissed with soft spicy hops result in a nice marzen lager unique to Shiner, Texas. Maybe its the water? Somewhat similar to the Bocks here in New England in days of yore, i.e. Narragansett, Schlitz, etc. yet most are now largely unavailable.

A super nice mid brownish almost copper color with a nice small off white head. Decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. Really digging the copper color of this brew. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of citrus with spices. You mostly pick up on cinnamon an ginger. The smells of the holidays. So far Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up the light roasted grains and malts, then a mild amount of spices. The spices are a nice touch to this brew. This brew has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The body of this German Bock is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold, Spices, Rich , Clean Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Samuel Adams Winter Lager a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams), did a super nice job with German Bock. 1,225 charactersnicholas2121, Dec 28, 2018\n",

Attractive. Taste is spicy - cinnamon, with a touch of citrus (orange?); finish is mildly bitter and malty. The totality is definitely holiday & winter focused. 389 charactersMNAle, Dec 13, 2018\n",
      "3.57/5  rDev -0.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.512oz bottle into a pint glass. Best by April 2019, so plenty fresh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nice deep red amber coloring. Initially there is a good thick off white head, but this dissipates to a thick ring & covering. light lacing\n",
      "\n",
      "Clean malty aroma. nothing else\n",
      "\n",
      "Malty, tingly, a little sweet. Claims to be brewed with orange peel, cinnamon & ginger, but I'm not getting any of those flavors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mouth is around medium. Finish seems a little off, faintly sour and a little unpleasant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, apart form the finish, not a bad tasting beer. It just doesn't deliver what the bottle states. 570 charactersMikeWard, Dec 10, 2018\n",
      "3.52/5  rDev -2.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5Pours a reddish amber with a thin off-white head. Mild caramel and spice aroma starts the beer off. Earthy notes are the first to come into play, with a dash of spices. Moderate body, with a bit of thickness to it. Very short finish of earthy notes and spice. Not too complex, but a decent winter drink. 308 charactersNephilium, Dec 05, 2018\n",
      "3/5  rDev -16.7%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3Amber color and clear with a tall tan head in a dimpled mug... I get the cinnamon and ginger, maybe some citrus and pine... Doesn't taste or smell particularly appealing though... Thin-bodied, mild... I guess it's alright, but i don't see the point when there are so many better and more flavorful beers out there... 316 charactersGreywulfken, Dec 03, 2018\n",

      "Taste: Slightly bitter malt, orange zest, and a biscuity finish. \n",
