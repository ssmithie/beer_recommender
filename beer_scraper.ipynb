The perfect beverage for any outdoor soirée, Garden Party delivers the sparkle of champagne, the floral delicacy of elderflowers and the brilliance of sweet lemon zest—bringing refinement and refreshment to your party, wherever it may be.\"\\n\\n5 oz pour on tap. The first sip yields heavy funk and a surprising amount of sweetness - not a great combination. However, the sweetness mellows out and gives way to oak, lemon, vanilla, white grape juice, and a floral component that must be the elderflowers. A unique beer for sure and decently complex. Not my favorite, but better than it seemed at first sip.'"

      "\n",
      "Nose: A hefty base of caramel malt is apparent on the nose. Slightly sweet, slightly toasty, crisp, and warm. Among the malt, a generous dose of Cascade hops waft up, with aromas of grapefruit, lemon, pine resin, pear, and perhaps even a note of sweet ripe mango. There is no earthiness, but rather a green element to the nose that evokes images of a forest. Lots of floral notes as well, including lilac, hyacinth, and Easter lilly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palate: Like the nose, the first sip unfolds with caramel malt. Semi-sweet, slightly toasty, and crisp, with notes of caramel, fresh bread, and toffee. Hops cut in rather late, bringing mostly pine sap, spring florals, cedar, and some citrus character. There is less of a grapefruit note than one might imagine with a beer like this. Cascade hops are not like Citra. They are piney, resinous, and sort of \"woodsy\". In fact, I would say the citrus notes in this beer are far closer to lemon than grapefruit. Only upon swallowing do the hops really overtake the malt, with a gentle bitterness showing up in the finish, amd the flavour profile becoming drier and more resinous. Still, well after the finish, the aforementioned caramel malt sweetness is still detectable in small doses around the palate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium bodied, crisp in nature, but the caramel malt provides a soft, slick, slightly chewy feel to it. For a pale ale, it certainly has some respectable weight to it, and a really employable softness. Effervescence is lively and plentiful, and also incredibly fine, almost champagne-like. Still, while the beer is crisp and drinkable, and although it has a fairly low ABV, I don't think I would want to drink more than 24oz in one sitting. This is one where the weight of the malt may creep up on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a classic. It's an old school, West Coast staple. Each of us have most likely consumed gallons of this stuff by this point, and there is a very good reason for that. It is a stellar beer. It's a no-frills, simple, easy, highly polished hoppy ale that does not demand one's attention with complexity, while remaining incredibly flavour-saturated, and never boring. It is a perfect default beer that most can agree on. It's affordable, it's tasty, it's incredibly consistent, and the quality is top notch. It won't win any awards for exotic hops or complex tropical fruit notes, but it does everything you want it to do and more, and for that, it really is one of the greatest pale ales on the market.\n",

It’s hard to believe it’s a “daily beer” for the amazing quality of taste and aroma and texture. No beer can touch this one for a daily drink ale. The Sierra Nevada hoppier ales (like the Little Hazy Thing and Celebration Ale) kick it up a notch with more highlights, but are truly a more “special brew” style not a daily brew to enjoy.

Fine ascending streams of effervescence are visible.\\n\\nNose: A hefty base of caramel malt is apparent on the nose. Slightly sweet, slightly toasty, crisp, and warm. Among the malt, a generous dose of Cascade hops waft up, with aromas of grapefruit, lemon, pine resin, pear, and perhaps even a note of sweet ripe mango. There is no earthiness, but rather a green element to the nose that evokes images of a forest. Lots of floral notes as well, including lilac, hyacinth, and Easter lilly.\\n\\nPalate: Like the nose, the first sip unfolds with caramel malt. Semi-sweet, slightly toasty, and crisp, with notes of caramel, fresh bread, and toffee. Hops cut in rather late, bringing mostly pine sap, spring florals, cedar, and some citrus character. There is less of a grapefruit note than one might imagine with a beer like this. Cascade hops are not like Citra. They are piney, resinous, and sort of \"woodsy\". In fact, I would say the citrus notes in this beer are far closer to lemon than grapefruit. Only upon swallowing do the hops really overtake the malt, with a gentle bitterness showing up in the finish, amd the flavour profile becoming drier and more resinous. Still, well after the finish, the aforementioned caramel malt sweetness is still detectable in small doses around the palate.\\n\\nMouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium bodied, crisp in nature, but the caramel malt provides a soft, slick, slightly chewy feel to it. For a pale ale, it certainly has some respectable weight to it, and a really employable softness. Effervescence is lively and plentiful, and also incredibly fine, almost champagne-like. Still, while the beer is crisp and drinkable, and although it has a fairly low ABV, I don\\'t think I would want to drink more than 24oz in one sitting. This is one where the weight of the malt may creep up on you.\\n\\nOverall: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a classic. It\\'s an old school, West Coast staple. Each of us have most likely consumed gallons of this stuff by this point, and there is a very good reason for that. It is a stellar beer. It\\'s a no-frills, simple, easy, highly polished hoppy ale that does not demand one\\'s attention with complexity, while remaining incredibly flavour-saturated, and never boring. It is a perfect default beer that most can agree on. It\\'s affordable, it\\'s tasty, it\\'s incredibly consistent, and the quality is top notch. It won\\'t win any awards for exotic hops or complex tropical fruit notes, but it does everything you want it to do and more, and for that, it really is one of the greatest pale ales on the market.\\n\\n 2,872 characters\\n\\nSierraNevallagash, Jun 06, 2019  Report',\n",

Ale yeast are known to produce by-products called esters, which are \"flowery\" and \"fruity\" aromas ranging, but not limited to apple, pear, pineapple, grass, hay, plum, and prune.\n",

A perfect description as lagers are brewed with bottom fermenting yeast that work slowly at around 34 degrees F, and are often further stored at cool temperature to mature. Lager yeast produce fewer by-product characters than ale yeast which allows for other flavors to pull through, such as hops.\n",
