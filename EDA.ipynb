Great deep copper, molasses color and pours with a brief head. Nice mouth feel with a good swallow. LET IT WARM UP A BIT is my best advice. Doesn’t do much when super cold, but a nice bread malt aroma...maybe a touch of spice is in there if you give it a chance. Not over the top and a reasonable bock buuuut a touch of hops may set some people off. I like this beer with dinner when I’m out eating warm, winter comfort food. Not a 4-5 range beer to buy to take home but a nice beverage on a cold night out.\\\\xa0566 charactersWilliamGustin, Yesterday at 11:04 PM\\', \\'2.74/5\\\\xa0\\\\xa0rDev -23.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75Very pretty copper color with no head to speak of.\\\\nSmell was disappointing. Maybe toast if I use my imagination...maybe.\\\\nThe first thing I tasted was hops. And if you like hops, that\\\\\\'s great. But I don\\\\\\'t love them, and Sam Adams said \"complimented by hops,\" which was inaccurate in my opinion.\\\\nTaste was similar to the smell - burnt toast, and something reminiscent of banana bread. The \"Cinnamon, ginger and orange peel\" were 100% undetectable. \\\\nMouthfeel was medium.\\\\nThis wasn\\\\\\'t a Christmas beer. It was just a beer, and not a very good one at that.

A super nice mid brownish almost copper color with a nice small off white head. Decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. Really digging the copper color of this brew. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of citrus with spices. You mostly pick up on cinnamon an ginger. The smells of the holidays. So far Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up the light roasted grains and malts, then a mild amount of spices. The spices are a nice touch to this brew. This brew has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The body of this German Bock is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold, Spices, Rich , Clean Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Samuel Adams Winter Lager a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to.

thin tan head. aroma of malt and unfortunately soap. and no this pour was not into a glass that was just washed so there is no soap residue. malt taste with a bit of spice. no complexity. moderate body and carbonation.\\xa0259 characterslastmango dec 14 2018 3.565\\xa0\\xa0rdev -1.1look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4beautiful deep amber color that invites you in. thick white head and minimal smell. tastes smooth but is better if you brush your glass rim with cinnamon and sugar. this is the perfect fix for the beer won’t drink it without the dressed up glass.\\xa0252

creamy; receding fairly quickly but it leaves nice-looking lacing on the opposite side of the glass. color is reddish amber; lots of carbonation bubbles. attractive. taste is spicy - cinnamon with a touch of citrus (orange); finish is mildly bitter and malty. the totality is definitely holiday & winter focused.\\xa0389 charactersmnale dec 13 2018 \"3.575\\xa0\\xa0rdev -0.8look: 4 | smell: 3.75 |

dissipates to a thick ring & covering. light lacing\\n\\nclean malty aroma. nothing else\\n\\nmalty tingly a little sweet. claims to be brewed with orange peel cinnamon & ginger but im not getting any of those flavors. \\n\\nmouth is around medium. finish seems a little off faintly sour and a little unpleasant. \\n\\noverall apart form the finish not a bad tasting beer. it just doesnt deliver what the bottle states.\\xa0570 charactersmikeward dec 10 2018\" 3.525\\xa0\\xa0rdev -2.2look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5pours a reddish amber with a thin off-white head. mild caramel and spice aroma starts the beer off. earthy notes are the first to come into play with a dash of spices. moderate body with a bit of thickness to it. very short finish of earthy notes and spice. not too complex but a decent winter drink.\\xa0308 charactersnephilium dec 05 2018 \"35\\xa0\\xa0rdev -16.7look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3amber color and clear with a tall

Great deep copper, molasses color and pours with a brief head. Nice mouth feel with a good swallow. LET IT WARM UP A BIT is my best advice. Doesn’t do much when super cold, but a nice bread malt aroma...maybe a touch of spice is in there if you give it a chance. Not over the top and a reasonable bock buuuut a touch of hops may set some people off. I like this beer with dinner when I’m out eating warm, winter comfort food. Not a 4-5 range beer to buy to take home but a nice beverage on a cold night out.\\\\xa0566 charactersWilliamGustin, Yesterday at 11:04 PM\\', \\'2.74/5\\\\xa0\\\\xa0rDev -23.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75Very pretty copper color with no head to speak of.\\\\nSmell was disappointing. Maybe toast if I use my imagination...maybe.\\\\nThe first thing I tasted was hops. And if you like hops, that\\\\\\'s great. But I don\\\\\\'t love them, and Sam Adams said \"complimented by hops,\" which was inaccurate in my opinion.\\\\nTaste was similar to the smell - burnt toast, and something reminiscent of banana bread. The \"Cinnamon, ginger and orange peel\" were 100% undetectable. \\\\nMouthfeel was medium.\\\\nThis wasn\\\\\\'t a Christmas beer. It was just a beer, and not a very good one at that.

There is a noticeable amount of hops, decent amount of bittering on the back end. \\\\nMouthfeel is medium. \\\\nOverall it’s a good Bock, I just can’t smell or taste any of the spices that are supposed to make it a “winter” beer.

A bready malt with a strong banana profile. (4.25\\\\n\\\\nFlavor: Flavor follows the nose with more citrus and bready spice. Lots of clove, nutmeg, and all-spice.

Finishes sweet, which often turns me off, but this was pleasant. The sweetness is attenuated and appropriate. The body is light enough to finish clean too.

This one had some nice hops to it, which I liked. Very nice to drink on a gloomy or incredibly snowy day when you have nothing to do and just want to stay inside all day. Love the German taste in it as well. Always will try and buy at least 2 six packs of this throughout the winter. Not tough to find around that time of year either, which is nice for convenience sake.\\\\xa0421 charactersDaveyCream, Mar 24, 2019\\', \\'3.63/5\\\\xa0\\\\xa0rDev +0.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75I\\\\\\'m diggin this right now.

A super nice mid brownish almost copper color with a nice small off white head. Decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. Really digging the copper color of this brew. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of citrus with spices. You mostly pick up on cinnamon an ginger. The smells of the holidays. So far Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up the light roasted grains and malts, then a mild amount of spices. The spices are a nice touch to this brew. This brew has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The body of this German Bock is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold, Spices, Rich , Clean Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Samuel Adams Winter Lager a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams), did a super nice job with German Bock.\\\\xa01,225 charactersnicholas2121, Dec 28, 2018\\', \"3.62/5\\\\xa0\\\\xa0rDev +0.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75Poured from bottle into tulip glass.

Great deep copper, molasses color and pours with a brief head. Nice mouth feel with a good swallow. LET IT WARM UP A BIT is my best advice. Doesn’t do much when super cold, but a nice bread malt aroma...maybe a touch of spice is in there if you give it a chance. Not over the top and a reasonable bock buuuut a touch of hops may set some people off. I like this beer with dinner when I’m out eating warm, winter comfort food. Not a 4-5 range beer to buy to take home but a nice beverage on a cold night out.\\\\xa0566 charactersWilliamGustin, Yesterday at 11:04 PM\\', \\'2.74/5\\\\xa0\\\\xa0rDev -23.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75Very pretty copper color with no head to speak of.\\\\nSmell was disappointing.

A super nice mid brownish almost copper color with a nice small off white head. Decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. Really digging the copper color of this brew. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of citrus with spices. You mostly pick up on cinnamon an ginger. The smells of the holidays. So far Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up the light roasted grains and malts, then a mild amount of spices. The spices are a nice touch to this brew. This brew has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The body of this German Bock is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold, Spices, Rich , Clean Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Samuel Adams Winter Lager a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to.
